The <ORG> Boston Bruins </ORG> put their <MISC> Stanley Cup </MISC> defense back on track with a convincing 4 - 1 win at home over the <ORG> Tampa Bay </ORG> Lightning Saturday in a re - match of their 2011 Eastern conference final . 

The <ORG> Bruins </ORG> , who raised their champions banner before crashing to a 2 - 1 loss to the <ORG> Philadelphia Flyers </ORG> in their season - opening game Thursday , had the measure of <LOC> Tampa Bay </LOC> again , with Rich Peverly leading the offence with two goals . 

Following a goal - less first period , <PER> Peverley </PER> sparked a scoring flurry of three goals in three minutes , tapping in a loose puck that had caromed off the goal post from a shot by <PER> Brad Marchand </PER> . 

¡° I think as long as we ¡¯re getting chances we ¡¯re going to be happy , ¡± <PER> Peverley </PER> said . 

And if we continue to get chances we ¡¯re going to win like tonight . 

We all did a good job of shooting the puck and getting second chances and that ¡¯s how we scored the goals . ¡± 

<ORG> Tampa Bay </ORG> ¡¯s <PER> Martin St. Louis </PER> scored his 300th NHL goal on a breakaway to tie the score before <PER> Daniel Paille </PER> restored the Bruins¡¯ lead , re - directing a shot from the blueline by <PER> Adam McQuaid </PER> . 

<PER> David Krejci </PER> and <PER> Peverley </PER> added a goal each in the third period as <ORG> Boston </ORG> finished with 42 scoring shots to <ORG> Tampa Bay ¡¯s </ORG> 26 , with <PER> Marchand </PER> and <PER> Tyler Seguin </PER> chipping in with two assists . 

¡° We were in this game going into the third , but if it was n¡¯t for our goaltender , it could ¡¯ve been a three - goal game at that point , ¡± said <LOC> St. Louis </LOC> of his goalie <PER> Mathieu Garon </PER> . 

¡° They just kind of circled our players . 

We got outplayed , <PER> outpoised </PER> , <PER> outmuscled </PER> and outbattled . 

There was n¡¯t much positive to take out of this game , besides the fact that our goalie gave us a chance going into the third period . ¡±

* Differences over temp workers , wage increase 

* Two sides to continue talking , UAW vows to get deal 

<ORG> Oshkosh Corp </ORG> turned down a new five - year contract offer from the company for a second time in little more than a week on Saturday even after union leaders narrowed differences between the two sides in recent days . 

More than 60 percent of hourly employees working in northeast <LOC> Wisconsin </LOC> plants represented by the <ORG> United Auto Workers union </ORG> voted to reject the contract , UAW Local 578 President <PER> Nick Nitschke </PER> said in an email to <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

The company ¡¯s desire to work with the UAW on future hiring of temporary workers remains a key sticking point , he said . 

UAW - represented workers at <LOC> Oshkosh </LOC> , totaling 3,000 more than employees , rejected <ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> ¡¯s first contract offer on Sept. 30 even though that meant losing a $ 2,000 signing bonus . 

Company and union officials spent the past week negotiating a new deal that included reworded language on seniority and temporary workers , and a revised financial package . 

<ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of military , fire and emergency and commercial vehicles . 

The labor talks are being closely watched by investors and analysts who have been concerned about the company ¡¯s exposure to a defense sector that is under pressure . 

Tension over temporary workers is n¡¯t the only problem still left to resolve . 

The company ¡¯s move to increase its pay - raise offer from 8 percent in the original contract offer to 8.5 percent through 2016 

¡° did n¡¯t fly with higher insurance costs , ¡± <PER> Nitschke </PER> said . 

<ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> is proposing to raise health care premiums and insurance co - pays 

¡° It ¡¯s time to get it done , ¡± said <PER> Nitschke </PER> , who expects to start bargaining again soon . 

We are not going to let it go on much longer ... 

Workers are expected to continue working as bargainers continue to negotiate .

<ORG> SACRAMENTO </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> California </LOC> Governor <PER> Jerry Brown </PER> on Saturday vetoed legislation that would have allowed <LOC> California </LOC> universities to consider race and gender in student admissions , even though <PER> Brown </PER> said he agreed with its goal . 

The measure was the latest attempt to scale back , or repeal , so - called Proposition 209 approved by voters in 1996 . 

It bars public agencies from considering race or ethnicity in everything from awarding contracts to accepting undergraduates . 

¡° I wholeheartedly agree with the goal of this legislation , ¡± <PER> Brown </PER> wrote in his veto message . 

But the <MISC> Democratic </MISC> governor said the courts should determine what should happen to Proposition 209 . 

For more than 15 years , Proposition 209 has prompted fierce debate . 

Opponents said it narrowed opportunities for women and minorities to succeed in <LOC> California </LOC> . 

Supporters countered that it simply created a system where individual ability was rewarded . 

The <ORG> California Supreme Court </ORG> last August ruled that it was constitutional . 

<MISC> Republican </MISC> students at the <ORG> University of California </ORG> , <LOC> Berkeley </LOC> recently took a satirical swipe at the proposed law vetoed by Brown by holding an affirmative action bake sale . 

They charged whites more for baked goods than other ethnicities . 

Hundreds of student protesters rallied in opposition to the event . 

The two main school systems that would have been affected by the law were the University of <LOC> California </LOC> and <ORG> California State University </ORG> . 

According to University of <LOC> California </LOC> statistics for the fall of 2009 , 32 percent of undergraduates were white , 3.5 <MISC> African American </MISC> , 16 percent Latino or Chicano and 30 percent <MISC> Asian </MISC> . 

<ORG> California State University statistics </ORG> for 2009 showed 38 percent of its undergraduates were white , six percent <MISC> African American </MISC> , 13 percent <MISC> Asian </MISC> and 25 percent Latino or Chicano . 

The figures may not add to 100 percent because of students who declined to give an ethnicity or those not counted such as international students . 

Women outnumbered men in both systems with 53 percent of undergraduates at the <ORG> University of California </ORG> and 58 percent of the student body at <LOC> California </LOC> State University . 

The <ORG> Texas Rangers </ORG> beat the <ORG> Detroit Tigers </ORG> 3 - 2 in a rain - interrupted opening game of the <MISC> American League Championship Series </MISC> on Saturday that featured a show - stopping performance by the home bullpen . 

<LOC> Texas </LOC> closer <PER> Neftali Feliz </PER> finished it off in style , striking out the side , getting his third strikes on pitches that hit 99 , 101 and 99 mph on the radar gun . 

The back of our bullpen is awesome , 

¡± <ORG> Rangers </ORG> catcher <PER> Mike Napoli </PER> said . 

When these guys come in , we expect them to throw zeros . 

The <ORG> Rangers </ORG> led 3 - 0 , including a <PER> Nelson Cruz </PER> home run against <ORG> Detroit </ORG> ace <PER> Justin Verlander </PER> , going into the fifth inning when two rain delays stalled play for almost two hours . 

<ORG> Detroit </ORG> scored a pair of runs in the rain - marred inning off <ORG> Rangers </ORG> starter <PER> C.J. Wilson </PER> , but a procession of five <ORG> Texas </ORG> relievers made the narrowest of advantages stand up . 

<PER> Verlander </PER> , who led the <MISC> American League </MISC> in wins ( 24 ) , earned run average ( 2.40 ) and strikeouts ( 250 ) took the loss . 

¡° I thought tonight his control was not good , ¡± <ORG> Detroit </ORG> manager <PER> Jim Leyland </PER> said about Verlander . 

He could n¡¯t get his curveball over for strikes when he needed to . ¡± 

<PER> Wilson </PER> had looked in control through four innings but after the first rain delay in the fifth he struggled . 

One run scored on an <PER> Austin Jackson </PER> double and another came across on a <PER> Wilson wild </PER> pitch after the left - <PER> hander </PER> had walked two batters to load the bases . 

After the second rain delay , left - hander reliever <PER> Mike Gonzalez </PER> came on and retired left - handed hitting <PER> Alex Avila </PER> with the bases loaded to end the <LOC> Detroit </LOC> threat . 

<PER> Alexi Ogando </PER> entered in the sixth and threw two innings of no - hit ball and was credited with the win . 

<PER> Darren Oliver </PER> and <PER> Mike Adams </PER> served as a bridge to <PER> Feliz </PER> , who overpowered the <ORG> Tigers </ORG> in the ninth . 

¡° It means we ¡¯re one game closer to getting to the <MISC> World Series </MISC> , ¡± <ORG> Texas </ORG> second baseman <PER> Ian Kinsler </PER> said . 

The <ORG> Rangers </ORG> took the lead against Verlander with two runs in the second inning on a run - scoring triple <PER> David Murphy </PER> and an <MISC> RBI </MISC> - single from <LOC> Kinsler </LOC> . 

<PER> Cruz </PER> , who was in a 1-for-16 playoffs slump , led off the fourth with a booming home run to left that made it 3 - 0 . 

The best - of - seven series continues Sunday with <PER> Derek Holland </PER> ( 16 - 5 in regular season ) scheduled to pitch for the <ORG> Rangers </ORG> against <ORG> Detroit </ORG> ¡¯s <PER> Max Scherzer </PER> ( 15 - 9 ) .

<LOC> BEIJING </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Communist Party </ORG> elite on Sunday marked a century since the revolution that ended millennia of rule by emperors , a date that has stoked warnings by critics that the party must tackle deeper reforms or also risk losing power . 

<LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s calendar is speckled with anniversaries heavy with political symbolism , and even the distant events that triggered the fall of the Qing dynasty and birth of a <LOC> republic </LOC> in 1911 - 12 have become a focus for controversy about the country ¡¯s future . 

President <PER> Hu Jintao </PER> said <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s history since the toppling of the Qing dynasty showed that one - party rule remained vital to the nation ¡¯s hopes for economic prosperity and political unity , including reunification with self - ruled <LOC> Taiwan </LOC> . 

To achieve the great revival of the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> nation , we must certainly firmly uphold the leadership of the <ORG> Chinese Communist Party </ORG> , ¡± <PER> Hu </PER> told hundreds of officials gathered in the cavernous Great Hall of the People in central <LOC> Beijing </LOC> in a nationally televised keynote speech celebrating the ¡° Xinhai Revolution . ¡± 

But the party ¡¯s version of the fall of the dynasty has been challenged by critics who say the chaotic chain of coups and insurrections that toppled the corrupt empire and subsequent violent faction conflicts and invasion by <LOC> Japan </LOC> are a reminder of the need for <MISC> democratic </MISC> reform in the present . 

<LOC> China </LOC> again faces a dangerous confluence of official corruption , volatile public discontent and stalled reform , <PER> Zhou Ruijin </PER> , the former deputy editor - in - chief of the <ORG> People ¡¯s Daily </ORG> newspaper said in a recent essay about the 1911 revolution . 

¡° Grievances , distrust and rancor that have accumulated over many years have reached a period when they break out , ¡± Zhou wrote in a <LOC> Beijing </LOC> magazine . 

In past months , authorities have shown how sensitive they are about liberal intellectuals using the events of 1911 as a mirror to criticize or cajole the government . 

Some seminars and debates about the anniversary have been canceled . 

For us , <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s Xinhai Revolution is still not dead history , it still has a strong resonance with present - day realities , ¡± said <PER> Lei Yi </PER> , an historian at the <ORG> Chinese Academy of Social Sciences </ORG> in <LOC> Beijing </LOC> . 

A key lesson of the revolution is that the country ¡¯s fate depends on whether the rulers make the right choices about advancing reforms . 

Above all , there ¡¯s still the issue that a modern <LOC> China </LOC> needs a modern form of government ¡ª constitutional government . 

The 1911 revolution has also been celebrated in television dramas and a movie whose stars include <PER> Jackie Chan </PER> , a martial arts actor better know for high kicks than high politics . 

President <PER> Hu </PER> is due to leave office from late next year , when a <ORG> Communist Party congress </ORG> will install a new leadership . 

The 1911 Revolution gave birth to the <LOC> Republic of China </LOC> in early 1912 under President <PER> Sun Yat </PER> - <LOC> sen </LOC> . 

<LOC> Taiwan </LOC> is still formally called the Republic of <LOC> China </LOC> after Nationalist forces fled there in 1949 to escape advanced Communist forces . 

<PER> Hu </PER> used his anniversary speech to warn <LOC> Taiwan </LOC> against ever pursuing outright independence and to call for closer ties with the island , which holds a presidential election in January . 

Among the guests in the <LOC> Great Hall </LOC> was 85-year - old former president <PER> Jiang Zemin </PER> , making a rare public appearance after widespread speculation in July that he was in failing health , even near death , after a heart attack .

Widespread corruption has bred resentment among many <MISC> Chinese </MISC> , who also feel aggrieved by the pollution and illegal land grabs that accompany <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s rapid economic growth .

was transferred into state hands after it acknowledged at the weekend that it could no longer meet requirements for further write downs . 

Its operations were to be transferred at the weekend to a new subsidiary under Finansiel Stabilitet , the state authority set up to handle failed <MISC> Danish </MISC> banks , <PER> Finansiel Stabilitet </PER> said in a statement late Saturday . 

It would be the 10th bank to fall into state hands since the start of the financial crisis in 2008 . 

The transfer of operations will be made under a recent adjustment to an existing government bank aid package , and the transfer would be effective on October 8 , <PER> Finansiel Stabilitet </PER> said . 

The bank would still be able to service its customers , <PER> Finansiel Stabilitet </PER> said . 

Last month , <MISC> Danish </MISC> political parties agreed to adjust a bank aid package to help the <MISC> Nordic </MISC> country ¡¯s smaller liquidity - squeezed banks and promote mergers within the sector . 

The agreement followed growing worries that more small <MISC> Danish </MISC> banks could fail . 

But it has offered little guarantee to creditors , which has contributed to a shortage of international funding to all but a handful of the country ¡¯s biggest banks . 

Also last month , <LOC> Denmark </LOC> ¡¯s central bank threw a lifeline to the country ¡¯s liquidity - squeezed banks by offering a new six - month loan based on its main lending rate and expanding the scope of collateral that it accepts from banks . 

<ORG> Max Bank </ORG> reported a net loss of 60.3 million <MISC> Danish </MISC> crowns ( $ 10.8 million ) in the first half of the year following 79.2 million crowns of write downs , but kept its 2011 outlook of a 80 million to 100 million crowns profit .

<LOC> BANGKOK </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Nearly 200 factories , including one run by <MISC> Japanese </MISC> car maker <ORG> Honda Motor Co Ltd </ORG> , closed in the central <MISC> Thai </MISC> province of <LOC> Ayutthaya </LOC> because of flooding , which could threaten <LOC> Bangkok </LOC> this week , officials said on Sunday . 

About 261 people have died since late July in flood - related incidents , the <ORG> Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation </ORG> said . 

Some 2.3 million people have been affected in the worst flooding to hit parts of <LOC> Thailand </LOC> in 50 years , mainly in the centre , north and northeast . 

The Rojana estate in <LOC> Ayutthaya </LOC> province , run by <ORG> Rojana Industrial Park Pcl </ORG> , was flooded after a wall of sandbags failed to hold back water overnight . 

¡° All 198 factories at Rojana have to be closed because the water is about 5.1 metres high , ¡± Industry Minister <PER> Wannarat Channukul </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

A <ORG> Honda </ORG> spokeswoman said it had moved about 3,000 assembled cars from the estate to other areas . 

<ORG> Hana Microelectronics Pcl </ORG> 

has also had to close its plant in <LOC> Ayutthaya </LOC> . 

On Thursday the Center for Economic and Business Forecasting , part of the University of the <ORG> Thai Chamber of Commerce </ORG> , cut its forecast for gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth this year to 3.6 percent from 4.4 percent because of the floods . 

It put the impact of the flooding at between 1.0 and 1.3 percentage points of GDP and said its new growth forecast would have been lower but for recent strength in exports . 

The <ORG> commerce ministry </ORG> said on Friday it had slashed its forecast for the main rice crop , which farmers are just starting to bring in , to 21 million tonnes from 25 million because of the flooding . 

<LOC> Thailand </LOC> is the world ¡¯s biggest rice exporter . 

The crop damage will add to the pressure on export prices , already being forced up by the high buying price set under a government intervention scheme aimed at helping poor farmers . 

<LOC> Bangkok </LOC> Governor <PER> Sukhumbhand Paribatra </PER> said in a statement the authorities were preparing an evacuation plan to move people from affected areas if floods hit the capital , much of which is just two metres above sea level . 

Some <LOC> riverside </LOC> areas have already suffered minor flooding but the level of the <LOC> Chao Phraya </LOC> River could rise sharply from Oct. 15 - 18 when a large amount of water will reach the area from the north , where dams are close to overflowing , at a time of high sea tides . 

The government was trying to accelerate the drainage of water from the <LOC> Chao Phraya </LOC> into the sea before the high tide . 

Other Southeast <MISC> Asian </MISC> countries have suffered serious flooding in recent weeks because of heavy monsoon rains combined with tropical storms . 

The death toll from two strong typhoons that cut across the north of the <LOC> Philippines¡¯ </LOC> main island and left behind widespread flooding had risen to 101 as of Sunday , the <ORG> national disaster agency </ORG> said . 

At least 167 people had died in <LOC> Cambodia </LOC> by late last week and 15 in <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> . 

Reliance Capital

Anti - <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> demonstrators said on Saturday they are growing out of their lower <LOC> Manhattan </LOC> encampment and are exploring options to expand to other public spaces in <LOC> New York City </LOC> . 

Protesters complaining about what they view as corporate greed have been camped out near <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> in <LOC> Zuccotti Park </LOC> for three weeks , staging rallies and marches that have mostly proceeded peacefully but have also resulted in confrontations with police . 

On Saturday , several hundred protesters marched north to <LOC> Washington Square Park </LOC> 

¡ª the site of protests against the <MISC> Vietnam War </MISC> in the 1960s and 1970s ¡ª to discuss expanding their encampment to other sites .

the protesters¡¯ name for <LOC> Zuccotti Park </LOC> , where about 250 have camped out around the clock . 

¡° It ¡¯s sometimes hard to move around there . 

By late on Saturday , no decision had been reached . 

The movement has surged in less than three weeks from a ragged group in <LOC> downtown Manhattan </LOC> to protesters of all ages demonstrating from <LOC> Seattle </LOC> to <LOC> Tampa </LOC> . 

The protesters object to the <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> bailout in 2008 , which they say left banks to enjoy huge profits while average <MISC> Americans </MISC> suffered under high unemployment and job insecurity . 

On Friday , Mayor <PER> Michael Bloomberg </PER> said the protests ¡° are n¡¯t productive ¡± and bad for tourism , even as he said he was sympathetic to some of their complaints .

<LOC> BEIJING </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Refined oil product stocks in <LOC> China </LOC> , the world ¡¯s second largest oil consumer , stood at 11.62 million tonnes as of Friday , edging up slightly from the end of September despite rising fuel sales , the top economic planner said on Sunday . 

The oil product inventory saw a big increase from a year earlier , the <ORG> National Development and Reform Commission </ORG> said on its website ( <ORG> www.ndrc.gov.cn </ORG> ) , but did not give a percentage change . 

Oil product sales at <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s two oil majors , the <ORG> China National Petroleum Corp </ORG> ( <ORG> CNPC </ORG> ) and <ORG> Sinopec Group </ORG> , rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier to 662,800 tonnes a day during the week - <MISC> long National Day </MISC> holidays from Oct. 1 to 7 , the <ORG> commission </ORG> said . 

Crude throughput at <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s refineries rose 1.9 percent from a year ago to 967,000 tonnes a day , or 7.06 million barrels per day ( bpd ) during the week , it said . 

Production of gasoline , kerosene and diesel held steady at 587,000 tonnes . 

However , domestic crude oil production fell 7.2 percent from a year earlier to 495,800 tonnes a day , or 3.62 million bpd , largely because of a significant drop in offshore oil production , it said . 

The government in September ordered a full shutdown of the country ¡¯s largest offshore oilfield , <LOC> Penglai </LOC> 19 - 3 , after a three - month oil spill in <LOC> Bohai Bay </LOC> by <ORG> ConocoPhillips </ORG> 

<LOC> China </LOC> , operator of the oilfield .

<PER> Bill Hader </PER> 's idiosyncratic character welcomed <PER> Derek Zoolander </PER> , the male model from host <PER> Ben Stiller </PER> 's 2001 " Zoolander . " 

He 's spent the last ten years coming up with a new look that will make you forget you ever stared longingly at his old one .

<PER> Vladimir Putin </PER> visits <LOC> China </LOC> on Tuesday in his first foreign trip since revealing plans to reclaim <LOC> Russia </LOC> ¡¯s presidency , addressing a challenging relationship with a giant neighbor whose growth is both an opportunity and a potential threat for <LOC> Moscow </LOC> . 

For <PER> Putin </PER> , whose main focus has been domestic in nearly four years as prime minister , the trip sets in motion a return to forefront of <MISC> Russian </MISC> foreign policy ahead of a March election in which he is expected to win a six - year term as president . 

Beneath talk of strategic relations and shared stances on world affairs , wrangling over a gas pact worth a potential $ 1 trillion points up the tough issues he will confront in dealing with <LOC> Russia </LOC> ¡¯s far more populous , faster growing neighbor . 

<LOC> China </LOC> , facing its own leadership transition next year , may try to gauge Putin ¡¯s plans for what could be 12 years at the helm of a country whose natural resources and nuclear arms make it a factor in <LOC> Beijing </LOC> ¡¯s economic and geopolitical strategies . 

The significance of this trip exceeds that of a normal prime minister - level visit , ¡± said <PER> Zhao Huasheng </PER> , director at the Center for <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <ORG> Central Asia Studies </ORG> at <LOC> Shanghai </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Fudan University </ORG> . 

<PER> Putin </PER> will bring an army of executives including the CEOs of state - controlled energy firms <ORG> Gazprom </ORG> and <ORG> Rosneft </ORG> and aluminum producer <ORG> UC RUSAL </ORG> , all eager to exchange their wares for <MISC> Chinese </MISC> cash . 

His meetings with <MISC> Chinese </MISC> President <PER> Hu Jintao </PER> and Prime Minister <PER> Wen Jiabao </PER> will feature warm affirmations of friendship and solidarity on big global issues between two countries that often move in lockstep to counter the <LOC> United States </LOC> and <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

Their double veto last week of a <MISC> European </MISC> - drafted , <LOC> U.S </LOC> .- backed <ORG> U.N. Security Council </ORG> resolution to condemn <LOC> Syria </LOC> ¡¯s crackdown on pro - democracy protesters was a warning against Western meddling in their own countries and others worldwide . 

<PER> Putin </PER> may use the trip to show the West an emphasis on <LOC> China </LOC> as <LOC> Russia </LOC> ¡¯s geopolitical partner and a customer for its energy . 

He did just that in a televised meeting with <ORG> Gazprom </ORG> CEO <PER> Alexei Miller </PER> on October 3 , pointedly ordering him to prepare proposals on expansion into <MISC> Asian </MISC> markets , seen as a way to diversify <MISC> Russian </MISC> energy exports away from stagnant <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

President <PER> Dmitry Medvedev </PER> has not been cool to <LOC> China </LOC> since Putin steered him into the <LOC> Kremlin </LOC> after his own 2000 - 2008 presidency , but his emphasis has been on presenting a friendlier face to the West and improving ties with the <LOC> United States </LOC> . 

<PER> Putin </PER> ¡¯s meeting with <PER> Miller </PER> followed <ORG> European Commission </ORG> raids on offices of <ORG> Gazprom </ORG> subsidiaries in <LOC> Europe </LOC> that underscored persistent tensions over the continent ¡¯s heavy reliance on <MISC> Russian </MISC> gas , which <ORG> EU </ORG> members want to reduce . 

But <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s friendly political ties with <LOC> Russia </LOC> , and their partnership in the loose BRIC grouping that also includes <LOC> India </LOC> and <LOC> Brazil </LOC> , do not make <LOC> Beijing </LOC> less of a tough customer when it comes to energy deals . 

<PER> Putin </PER> will likely seek to resolve the price disagreements that have prevented <LOC> Russia </LOC> nailing down a 30-year deal to supply <LOC> China </LOC> with up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas per year . 

But <ORG> Gazprom </ORG> ¡¯s export chief told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> last month that the five - year - old negotiations might not end this year , pushing back initial deliveries beyond the latest target of 2016 . 

Meanwhile , <LOC> China </LOC> is cultivating other sources of energy supplies , particularly in ex - <MISC> Soviet </MISC> Central <LOC> Asia </LOC> . 

A report this month by the <ORG> Stockholm International Peace Research Institute </ORG> ( <ORG> SIPRI </ORG> ) said <LOC> China </LOC> was gaining the upper hand in the relationship as it becomes less reliant on <LOC> Russia </LOC> for advanced weapons and looks elsewhere for some of its energy . 

It said <LOC> Russia </LOC> ¡¯s significance to <LOC> China </LOC> would continue to diminish in the coming years , and that ¡° there are strategic planners in <LOC> Beijing </LOC> and <LOC> Moscow </LOC> who view the other side as the ultimate strategic threat in the long term . 

While <PER> Putin </PER> may use <LOC> China </LOC> as a foil against the West , the pragmatic former KGB officer is well aware of such concerns . 

As he prepares for what could be two six - year terms as president , ¡° the risks from <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s growth will be watched more closely than the opportunities , ¡± said <PER> Fyodor Lukyanov </PER> , editor of the <ORG> journal Russia in Global Affairs </ORG> . 

At an investor conference on Thursday , <PER> Putin </PER> used a joke to play down the challenge posed by <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s faster growth after <ORG> TPG Capital co </ORG> - founder <PER> David Bonderman </PER> outlined <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s path to becoming the world ¡¯s largest economy . 

He said that the <LOC> United States </LOC> is so far the world ¡¯s biggest economy but <LOC> China </LOC> will undoubtedly take over . 

So we now need to keep our foreign currency reserves in yuan while the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> will keep them in dollars , ¡± <PER> Putin </PER> said . 

That will be an interesting <MISC> Russian </MISC> doll . ¡±

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Evidence shows that quantitative easing does support the economy and there is no reason to believe that it feeds directly into inflation without supporting growth , Bank of <LOC> England </LOC> policymaker <PER> Martin Weale </PER> told <ORG> Sky </ORG> News on Sunday . 

The work that the bank has done on the issue has suggested quantitative easing does support the economy , ¡± he told the broadcaster . 

When asked if the state of the economy would have been worse if 200 billion pounds had not been pumped in , he said : ¡° I think so . 

Obviously there is uncertainty about the exact impact , and equally we do n¡¯t know whether the impact in the future will be similar to what we think it was in the past . 

But I have not heard anyone suggesting that quantitative easing actually inhibits the growth of the economy , that it fails to provide support . 

Some people have suggested that it translates fairly directly into inflation without supporting economic growth , and I ca n¡¯t see any reason why that should be the case 

, I have n¡¯t heard of a convincing mechanism why that should be the case . 

The BoE voted on Thursday to buy 75 billion pounds more in assets to shield <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s economy from the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis and keep the faltering recovery going . 

Here 's the dilemma about Sunday night 's " Breaking Bad " season finale : We ca n't wait to see it . 

But once we do , we wo n't get any more " Breaking Bad " episodes for ¡­ 

The show 's fourth season has cemented its status as one of the best TV dramas ever , and , we might even argue , the best TV show ever , period . 

Fans of " The Wire " and " The Sopranos " and " Mad Men " will make their own arguments , but we challenge anyone to honestly point to another series that , episode after episode , season after season , entertains as much as this one .

Series creator <PER> Vince Gilligan </PER> , the writers , the crew , and the Emmy - winning cast have built a sometimes unbearable amount tension into season four , with payoffs both subtle ( <PER> Hank </PER> 's theory about the industrial laundry operation ! ) and shocking ( poor , dumb <PER> Ted Beneke </PER> ) . 

They 've also managed an astonishing amount of humor in a show about a chemistry teacher who starts cooking meth with his slacker former student after a terminal cancer diagnosis . 

Much of the credit goes to comic mastermind <PER> Bob Odenkirk </PER> ( Better call <PER> Saul </PER> ) 

Everything so far comes to a head in Sunday 's season <PER> ender </PER> , as the inevitable showdown between <PER> Walt </PER> and his drug boss <PER> Gus </PER> ( <PER> Giancarlo Esposito </PER> ) plays out . 

<PER> Jesse </PER> and <PER> Walt </PER> 's entire family are caught in the <LOC> middle </LOC> . 

We ca n't wait to see how it unfolds . 

Even though we 'll have to wait ¡ª until the summer of 2012 , most likely ¡ª to check back in with our favorite <LOC> Albuquerque </LOC> residents for the show 's fifth and final season .

* <ORG> UBS </ORG> capital dented by trading scandal 

The <MISC> Swiss </MISC> authorities have convened a crisis committee set up after the 2008 government bailout of <ORG> UBS </ORG> 

to discuss the possible impact on the big banks of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis , the <ORG> NZZ am Sonntag </ORG> newspaper reported on Sunday . 

Citing two unnamed sources , the newspaper said the committee had become active as concerns mount that the problems in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone could trigger a new financial crisis that would spread through the banking sector again . 

The committee is led by <PER> Patrick Raaflaub </PER> , director of the <ORG> FINMA financial markets regulator </ORG> , and also includes <PER> Fritz Zurbruegg </PER> , head of the <ORG> Swiss finance department </ORG> , as well as central bank vice chairman <PER> Thomas Jordan </PER> , the paper said . 

<ORG> FINMA </ORG> was not immediately available for comment on the report .

¡° On an international comparison , the two banks have an above average amount of capital . 

But they must further improve the quality of their equity capital , ¡± he told the newspaper . 

It is no secret that we are encouraging the institutes to reach their objectives faster than is mandatory . ¡± 

<ORG> UBS </ORG> said last week the $ 2.3 billion it lost in a trading scandal meant its Tier 1 capital ratio would decline slightly at the end of the third quarter from the strong 18.1 percent it reported at the end of the previous quarter .

<MISC> European </MISC> banks may need more than 100 billion euros ( $ 135 billion ) to withstand the sovereign debt crisis , <LOC> Ireland </LOC> estimated on Saturday ahead of a meeting between <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> to work out how to recapitalize the lenders . 

The falling value of banks¡¯ holdings of government debt from <LOC> Greece </LOC> and other <MISC> euro </MISC> zone periphery states has already provoked the implosion of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> lender <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , adding urgency to the <PER> Merkel </PER> - <PER> Sarkozy </PER> talks . 

There is a high risk that this crisis further escalates and broadens , ¡± <MISC> German </MISC> Finance Minister <PER> Wolfgang Schaeuble </PER> told <MISC> German </MISC> paper <ORG> Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung </ORG> in an interview released in advance of publication on Sunday . 

<LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> have so far been split over how to strengthen shaky lenders and fight financial market contagion that may follow a possible <MISC> Greek </MISC> default . 

<LOC> Paris </LOC> is keen to tap the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s 400 billion rescue fund , the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> , to recapitalize its own banks , while <LOC> Berlin </LOC> is insisting the fund should be used as a last resort . 

The <ORG> International Monetary Fund </ORG> ( <ORG> IMF </ORG> ) has said <MISC> European </MISC> banks need 200 billion euros in additional funds . 

<MISC> Irish </MISC> Finance Minister <PER> Michael Noonan </PER> said the capital needed to bolster banks¡¯ cushions was likely to come from a variety of sources but the total bill would be large . 

I think there is general agreement that it will be significantly in excess of 100 billion ( euros ) , ¡± <PER> Noonan </PER> told reporters on the sidelines of an economic forum in <LOC> Dublin </LOC> . 

¡° I know that some of the big <MISC> German </MISC> banks that I was talking to personally intend raising money on the market so it will be private funding . 

Other banks would like to avail of the <ORG> EFSF fund </ORG> . 

Other banks will rely on their sovereign governments to provide the capital so there is going to be a range of ways of doing it , ¡± he said . 

Regulators worry that forcing a raft of major lenders to take state aid would not be the best use of <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s limited capital resources , while banks fear than singling out only some lenders for extra support could heighten market worries about weaknesses at individual banks . 

<MISC> German </MISC> newspaper <ORG> Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung </ORG> on Saturday cited financial sources as saying <LOC> France </LOC> ¡¯s five - biggest lenders would agree to take 10 - 15 billion euros in funding from the state but also wanted to see <LOC> Germany </LOC> ¡¯s No . 1 lender <ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> plump its capital cushion . 

But a senior <MISC> French </MISC> banking source shot down the idea that <MISC> French </MISC> banks could be pushing for state aid , saying the <ORG> Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung </ORG> report was baseless . 

I do n¡¯t know what game the <MISC> Germans </MISC> are playing ... 

This is wishful thinking , ¡± the source told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> , asking not to be named . 

<ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> Chief Executive <PER> Josef Ackermann </PER> is against any role for the state in his own bank ¡¯s capital position and has ruled out a capital increase . 

A <ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> spokesman on Saturday referred to <PER> Ackermann </PER> ¡¯s long - standing public position and declined further comment . 

The chief financial officer of <ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> unit , <ORG> Deutsche Postbank </ORG> , said he expected the 21 percent haircut on <MISC> Greek </MISC> bonds that international banks agreed to take as part of a <ORG> EU </ORG> - brokered debt relief deal in July would not be enough . 

Therefore we would expect renewed writedowns in the third quarter , ¡± <ORG> Postbank </ORG> ¡¯s <PER> Marc Hess </PER> told <ORG> Boersen </ORG> - <ORG> Zeitung </ORG> newspaper . 

Banks¡¯ need to gird their capital bases is also leading some to merge , such as <LOC> Spain </LOC> ¡¯s 

No . 5 retail bank <ORG> Banco </ORG> Popular , which launched an all - share bid for its smaller rival <ORG> Banco </ORG> Pastor on Friday . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> is due to arrive in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> on Sunday afternoon and hold a working dinner with <PER> Merkel </PER> in the evening , amid signs that conditions for resolving the crisis are getting no easier . 

<LOC> Slovakia </LOC> ¡¯s coalition government was in deadlock on Saturday over talks on ratifying a strengthening of the <ORG> EFSF rescue fund </ORG> , with a junior party insisting on conditions for its support . 

<MISC> Euro </MISC> zone minnows <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> and <LOC> Malta </LOC> are the last countries holding up expansion of the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> mandate , which is needed to fight the sovereign debt crisis [ ID : nL5E7L806 G ] 

Angry <MISC> Greeks </MISC> have taken to the streets to protest government efforts to slash spending , boost taxes and privatize state companies but <MISC> Belgian </MISC> Finance Minister 

<PER> Didier Reynders </PER> said the pain could not go on indefinitely . 

This is not acceptable on a political , social or even economic level : we do not want the cure to kill <LOC> Greece </LOC> , ¡± <PER> Reynders </PER> told <MISC> Greek </MISC> newspaper <ORG> Proto Thema </ORG> in an interview . 

Meanwhile , <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s representative at the IMF said the country ¡¯s borrowing needs will be higher than currently projected due to a tougher - than - expected recession and the outcome of a debt agreement with private sector creditors . 

¡° This financing gap will have to be covered either by increasing the 109 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> loan agreed on July 21 or through a restructuring of private debt , ¡± <PER> Panagiotis Roumeliotis </PER> said in an interview in financial daily Imerisia .

With their favored candidates for the 2012 <MISC> Republican </MISC> presidential nomination lagging or out of the race , many <LOC> U.S. </LOC> Tea Party activists are shifting focus to the struggle for control of the <ORG> U.S. Senate </ORG> . 

The <ORG> fizz </ORG> has gone out of the presidential contest for some supporters of the fiscally conservative movement now that former <LOC> Alaska </LOC> governor <PER> Sarah Palin </PER> is not running and <LOC> Texas </LOC> Governor <PER> Rick Perry </PER> and congresswoman <PER> Michele Bachmann </PER> are slipping in polls . 

No one is going to get perfect in a general election candidate . 

That is why we think the <ORG> Senate </ORG> is a better place to focus , ¡± said <PER> Matt Kibbe </PER> , president and chief executive of the <ORG> libertarian FreedomWorks </ORG> , a Tea Party group . 

In the 2010 mid - term elections , Tea Party opposition to President Barack Obama ¡¯s policies played a big role in slashing the Democrats¡¯ majority in the <ORG> 100-member Senate </ORG> to just six seats and eliminating their majority in the <ORG> House of Representatives </ORG> . 

With 23 of the 33 <ORG> Senate </ORG> seats up for grabs next year now held by <MISC> Democrats </MISC> , and a wave of public hostility to incumbents , Tea Party activists said they looked forward to more <MISC> Republican </MISC> gains in 2012 . 

¡° We ¡¯ll maintain the House without a problem . 

We absolutely have to take back the <ORG> Senate </ORG> and focus on that and not let presidential politics consume all of our time and energy , ¡± said <PER> Amy Kremer </PER> , chairwoman of the <LOC> California </LOC> - <ORG> based Tea Party Express Political Action Committee </ORG> . 

Some of the eight to 10 <ORG> Senate </ORG> seats seen as very competitive next year are in <LOC> Wisconsin </LOC> , <LOC> Florida </LOC> and <LOC> Ohio </LOC> , <LOC> states </LOC> where Tea Party groups had a big impact in 2010 and during state legislative sessions , fueling optimism about next year , <PER> Kibbe </PER> said . 

¡° If the issues are the economy and jobs , the burden of spending and the national debt , those are swing issues that Tea Partiers care about most ¡ª there is a nice confluence in what motivates independent voters and what motivates Tea Partiers , ¡± he said . 

Fueling the Tea Party ¡¯s disenchantment with the <MISC> Republican </MISC> presidential race are suspicions that front - runner <PER> Mitt Romney </PER> is too moderate and not committed to core conservative causes . 

The Tea Party favors lower spending and smaller government . 

The former <LOC> Massachusetts </LOC> governor has been attacked by conservatives for introducing a healthcare program in the state that many say was a model for the sweeping healthcare overhaul enacted by Obama in 2010 . 

¡° People are definitely not rallying to Romney , ¡± said <PER> Chris Littleton </PER> , <ORG> co </ORG> - founder of the <ORG> Ohio Liberty Council </ORG> , a coalition of about 80 Tea Party groups in <LOC> Ohio </LOC> , a swing state considered a must - win for any <MISC> Republican </MISC> presidential candidate . 

¡° I can not recall a single conversation I ¡¯ve had with anyone who is conservative and liberty - minded where that person supports Romney , ¡± he said . 

Some are shifting allegiance to <PER> Herman Cain </PER> , who has gained in recent polls and appeals to Tea Party activists with a plan to drastically overhaul the tax code , but <PER> Cain </PER> has yet to prove he can assemble the strong campaign team or attract the level of donations he would need to secure the nomination . 

<PER> Romney </PER> ¡¯s campaign said his platform of reduced taxes , lower spending and limited government would appeal to <MISC> Republicans </MISC> , the Tea Party and even some <MISC> Democrats </MISC> , and that he would continue to reach out to all voters . 

In the end , Tea Party voters are expected to put aside ideological differences with Romney if he does become the nominee , because their primary goal in next year ¡¯s presidential race is denying Obama a second term . 

¡° The Tea Party to some extent , though not completely , was born in reaction to the Obama movement . 

Certainly their number one priority is going to be to beat Barack Obama in the fall . 

There ¡¯s no question about that , ¡± said <PER> Doug Heye </PER> , a political consultant and former <ORG> Republican National Committee </ORG> spokesman . 

<PER> Sal Russo </PER> , chief <ORG> strategist and co </ORG> - <ORG> founder of the Tea Party Express </ORG> , said he viewed all the <MISC> Republican </MISC> candidates as fiscally conservative enough for the Tea Party . 

Besides , he added , in the end the movement ¡¯s supporters want a candidate who can win . 

¡° It certainly does n¡¯t do us any good to run and lose , ¡± he said .

Here are some details of the 69-year - old singer - songwriter ¡¯s life : 

¡ª <PER> Paul McCartney </PER> , <PER> John Lennon </PER> and <PER> George Harrison </PER> first played together in a group called The <ORG> Quarrymen </ORG> in the late 1950s . 

They eventually became The Beatles and recruited <PER> Ringo Starr </PER> . 

They played in clubs in northern <LOC> England </LOC> and made several tours of <LOC> West Germany </LOC> . 

In 1962 , the <MISC> Beatles recorded ¡° Love </MISC> Me Do , ¡± the first of a string of hits by <PER> Lennon </PER> and <PER> McCartney </PER> that included ¡° 

¡ª After the Beatles split in 1970 , <PER> McCartney </PER> was still writing songs . 

Mull of <LOC> Kintyre </LOC> , ¡± which he recorded with his group Wings in 1977 , topped the <MISC> British </MISC> charts for nine weeks . 

Though he delivered another standard McCartney pop - rock album in 1993 , ¡° Off the Ground , ¡± <PER> McCartney </PER> was starting to experiment with other genres . 

In 1991 he composed the ¡° <ORG> Liverpool </ORG> Oratorio , ¡± later performed by the <LOC> London Symphony </LOC> Orchestra . 

Other forays into classical music have included ¡° Standing Stone ¡± ( 1997 ) , 

¡° Working Classical ¡± ( 1999 ) , ¡° Ecce <MISC> Cor Meum ¡± </MISC> ( 2006 ) and , 

this year , a ballet score , <LOC> ¡° Ocean ¡¯s Kingdom </LOC> . 

¡ª <PER> McCartney </PER> continues to tour and perform , sometimes with <PER> Ringo Starr </PER> . 

¡ª <PER> McCartney </PER> was born in <LOC> Liverpool </LOC> , <LOC> England </LOC> , on June 18 , 1942 . 

His father was a cotton salesman and part - time leader of a jazz band . 

His mother , a school health officer , died suddenly when he was 14 . 

¡ª Although he qualified for university , <PER> McCartney </PER> ¡¯s interest in pop music dictated his future . 

Together with <PER> John Lennon </PER> , whom he met at 15 , he began learning the guitar . 

¡ª <PER> McCartney </PER> quickly became a heartthrob .

- <PER> Andy Murray </PER> reduced <PER> Rafa Nadal </PER> ¡¯s granite - like resistance to rubble as he stunned the <MISC> Spaniard </MISC> 3 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 0 to capture the <MISC> Japan Open </MISC> tennis on Sunday . 

It was the <MISC> Briton </MISC> ¡¯s second title in two weeks , after he won in <LOC> Bangkok </LOC> , and ended <PER> Nadal </PER> ¡¯s bid to become the first man since <PER> Pete Sampras </PER> in 1993 - 94 to retain the <LOC> Tokyo </LOC> crown . 

I played some great tennis , especially in the third set , ¡± <PER> Murray </PER> told reporters after inflicting the dreaded ¡® bagel¡¯ on Nadal in the decider to win his 20th career title . 

¡° It was the best tennis I ¡¯ve played against <PER> Rafa </PER> , 

¡± added the <PER> Scot </PER> , who had lost 13 of his previous 17 matches against the world number two . 

<PER> Murray </PER> , who has won 21 of his last 22 matches , will wish he could bottle the magic he produced in an astonishing third set , when he dropped just four points . 

¡° To only lose four points - and against Rafa - will never happen again , ¡± he said . 

I ¡¯ve hit the ball like that before but for such a long period , that ¡¯s definitely the first time . 

¡° I ¡¯ve given myself the target of ending the year at number three ( in the world ) 

so hopefully I can carry on that form . ¡± 

<PER> Murray </PER> , who can close the gap on <PER> Roger Federer </PER> further in <LOC> Shanghai </LOC> next week , returned to court after a quick rubdown to win the <LOC> Tokyo </LOC> doubles with brother <PER> Jamie </PER> . 

¡° Winning with my brother makes it the perfect week , ¡± he said , the singles trophy gleaming beside him . 

Top seed <PER> Nadal </PER> took the first set on a superb lunging volley but <PER> Murray </PER> hit back brilliantly , breaking for 3 - 1 in the second with a rifled forehand into the corner . 

<PER> Murray </PER> , accused in the past of having a ¡® glass jaw¡¯ , nervelessly saved triple break point in the next game with three cracking aces to leave <PER> Nadal </PER> shaking his head in disbelief . 

The second seed , who had been screaming at himself and pointing furiously at his box in the first set , leveled the match with a bullet backhand that <PER> Nadal </PER> could only dump into the net . 

<PER> Nadal </PER> ¡¯s game unraveled and the 10-times <MISC> grand slam </MISC> champion wore the look of a tortured man in the final set as <PER> Murray </PER> caught fire , ripping winner after winner past him . 

<PER> Nadal </PER> overtook world number one <PER> Novak Djokovic </PER> for most match wins this year with his 65th in his semi - final victory over <PER> Mardy Fish </PER> , but he had no answer to <PER> Murray </PER> ¡¯s power . 

Fans of <PER> Nadal </PER> , many draped in <MISC> Spanish </MISC> flags and some in red - and - yellow , afro - style wigs , fell silent as <PER> Murray tore </PER> through the decider in 29 minutes . 

<PER> Murray </PER> set up triple match point with a rocket forehand down the line before forcing <PER> Nadal </PER> into a loose backhand to end a pulsating final after two hours , 16 minutes . 

He deserves the title , ¡± said <PER> Nadal </PER> , playing his first tournament since helping <LOC> Spain </LOC> to reach the <MISC> Davis Cup </MISC> final last month . 

¡° I ¡¯ve lost a few sets 6 - 0 of course . 

You prefer it does n¡¯t happen , but he played fantastic and in the third set he started to play at a really high level .

* Policymaker says evidence shows QE boosts economy - <ORG> Sky News </ORG> 

* Says no reason why QE should feed inflation without supporting growth 

* Sees ¡° scope for further quantitative easing ¡± 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Evidence shows that quantitative easing boosts the economy and there is no reason to believe that it feeds directly into inflation without supporting growth , Bank of <LOC> England </LOC> policymaker <PER> Martin Weale </PER> told <ORG> Sky </ORG> News on Sunday . 

The work that the bank has done on the issue has suggested quantitative easing does support the economy , ¡± the external <ORG> Monetary Policy Committee </ORG> member told the broadcaster . 

Obviously there is uncertainty about the exact impact , and equally we do n¡¯t know whether the impact in the future will be similar to what we think it was in the past , ¡± he said when asked if the state of the economy would have been worse if the bank had not bought 200 billion pounds 

( $ 312 billion)of financial assets , mostly gilts , between March 2009 and January 2010 . 

The <ORG> Bank of England </ORG> ( <ORG> BoE </ORG> ) voted on Thursday to buy 75 billion pounds more in assets to shield <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s economy from the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis and keep the faltering recovery going . 

Some people have suggested that it translates fairly directly into inflation without supporting economic growth , and I ca n¡¯t see any reason why that should be the case , ¡± <PER> Weale </PER> said . 

¡° Obviously the future is uncertain and we do n¡¯t know how 

much support will be provided 

but I certainly think it is an 

appropriate response to a weakening economic ( situation ) . 

In August , <PER> Weale </PER> ditched his call for a rate hike . 

¡° There is quite a lot of scope for further quantitative easing , ¡± he said . 

¡° Before the purchases that we announced last week , the amount of government debt in the system was actually higher than it had been before the earlier bout of quantitative 

easing . ¡± 

Thursday ¡¯s decision to expand its asset purchase programme to a total of 275 billion pounds highlights the precarious state of <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s economy as global growth slows , government spending cuts and tax hikes bite and consumers face high inflation and slow wage rises . 

<PER> Weale </PER> told <ORG> Sky </ORG> the bank could not be expected to reach its 2 percent inflation target in the very short term without a very tight squeeze on the economy , ¡° and I have n¡¯t heard anyone thinking that ¡¯s a good idea . ¡± 

The horizon we work to is a two to three - year horizon , and with the economy having weakened now , that means that inflation prospects in two to three years¡¯ time ( are ) less worrying than I had thought they were , and so that justifies a slacker policy , ¡± he added . 

On Friday , <ORG> Moody ¡¯s </ORG> cut the credit rating of some <MISC> British </MISC> banks due to the likelihood of less state support in a future crisis . 

¡° It ¡¯s not reflecting problems with <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s banks , ¡± <PER> Weale </PER> added . 

* Civic Platform led Law and Justice in opinion polls 

* Civic Platform says it guarantees stability , reform 

* Law and Justice victory could test <LOC> Russia </LOC> , <LOC> Germany </LOC> ties 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> voted in a parliamentary election on Sunday that could give Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> ¡¯s centre - right Civic Platform four more years in power to pursue gradual economic reforms and preserve political stability . 

Civic Platform , which guided <LOC> Poland </LOC> through the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis and favours closer ties with the rest of the <ORG> European Union </ORG> , would be the first party to hold on to power in an election in <LOC> Poland </LOC> since the collapse of Communism in 1989 . 

Opinion polls show no party will win an outright majority and another four years of coalition government are likely in the country of more than 38 million people after Civic Platform ¡¯s four - year alliance with the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> . 

The polls put outspoken ex - premier <PER> Jaroslaw Kacynski </PER> ¡¯s conservative - <ORG> nationalist Law and Justice party </ORG> in second place . 

His return to power after four years in opposition could strain ties with <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> but is widely considered unlikely because his party would struggle to forge a coalition . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> , 54 , <PER> portrays </PER> himself as a guardian of stability . 

A mild - mannered pragmatist with a common touch , he has eschewed radical economic reforms , avoided talk of austerity despite a large budget deficit and promised to continue cautious reforms . 

Law and Justice has promised more state involvement in the economy , including a bank tax and higher taxes for the rich , and vowed to wind down large - scale privatisation . 

<ORG> ¡° PO </ORG> ( Civic Platform ) should continue to govern because they have done a great deal . 

Just look at the roads , ¡± said <PER> Maria Mlodzikowska </PER> , an 80-year - old retired physical education teacher , after voting in <LOC> Warsaw </LOC> . 

But <PER> Jan Mazur </PER> , a 74-year - old retired printer , said he had voted for Law and Justice for the sake of his grandchildren . 

¡° I do n¡¯t want them to grow up in a country which owns nothing because the PO has sold everything off under the pretext of what they call privatisation , ¡± he said . 

More than 30 million people are eligible to vote . 

They will elect 460 lawmakers in the lower house , the Sejm , and 100 to the upper chamber , the <ORG> Senate </ORG> . 

Voting started at 7 a.m. ( 0500 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) and ends at 9 p.m. ( 1900 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) , when the first exit polls will be released . 

The official result will take several hours to come in . 

Police said two polling stations in the eastern city of <LOC> Lublin </LOC> were closed because of a bomb scare but there were no other reports of problems across the <ORG> NATO </ORG> member state . 

Ratings agencies say they could downgrade <LOC> Poland </LOC> if it 

does not swiftly act to reduce the budget deficit , expected to reach 5.6 percent of gross domestic product this year , and the public debt , expected to reach 53.8 percent of GDP this year . 

Economists doubt Law and Justice would be able to meet the challenge . 

The current coalition , however , has failed to deliver on promises of far - reaching liberal market reforms . 

The <ORG> EU </ORG> ¡¯s largest former communist economy has lost some of its lustre since 2007 when <PER> Tusk </PER> took power , but <LOC> Poland </LOC> was the only <ORG> EU </ORG> state to maintain positive growth through the turmoil of 2008 - 2009 and growth is estimated at 4 percent this year . 

The <MISC> Euro </MISC> 2012 soccer championship , which <LOC> Poland </LOC> will co - host with <LOC> Ukraine </LOC> , should also boost demand . 

If <PER> Tusk </PER> wins but can not forge a strong coalition with just the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> , he may have to turn to <PER> Palikot </PER> ¡¯s Movement , a new party that supports gay rights , abortion and legalisation of soft drugs for support . 

Led by <PER> Janusz Palikot </PER> , a wealthy businessman and former Civic Platform lawmaker , the party has criticised <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s powerful <MISC> Catholic </MISC> Church . 

¡° I support Palikot ... at least he ¡¯ll be a breath of fresh air in the stiflingly stodgy Sejm , ¡± said <PER> Krystyna Celinska </PER> , a 28-year - old graphic artist . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> favours deeper <ORG> EU </ORG> integration despite the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis and has sought stable ties with <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> , its largest and most powerful neighbours . 

<PER> Kaczynski </PER> , 62 , deeply distrusts the countries which carved up <LOC> Poland </LOC> under a <MISC> Nazi </MISC> - <MISC> Soviet </MISC> pact before <MISC> World War Two </MISC> and also raised eyebrows during the election campaign by repeating in a new book his view that <LOC> Berlin </LOC> is trying to subdue <LOC> Poland </LOC> . 

¡° I back <ORG> PiS ( Law and Justice </ORG> ) because they put <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s interests ahead of those of <LOC> Brussels </LOC> or <LOC> Berlin </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Maria Derkacz </PER> , a translator in her early 60s . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> has continued the rapprochement with <LOC> Moscow </LOC> , which held sway over <LOC> Poland </LOC> for decades after <MISC> World War Two </MISC> , despite a setback since a plane crash last year killed then - President <PER> Lech Kaczynski </PER> , <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s twin , and 95 others . 

<LOC> Moscow </LOC> says mistakes by <MISC> Polish </MISC> pilots were the sole cause of the crash . 

<LOC> Warsaw </LOC> believes <MISC> Russian </MISC> ground controllers also played a role in the tragedy and <PER> Kaczynski </PER> says <PER> Tusk </PER> and <MISC> Russian </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Vladimir Putin </PER> bore some responsibility . 

but he will prevent <PER> Kaczynski </PER> getting into power , ¡± said <PER> Andrzej Antczak </PER> , a 42-year - old communications specialist . 

Online gaming firm <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> 

is close to agreeing the sale of its <MISC> Turkish </MISC> gambling business to <ORG> GVC </ORG> , clearing an obstacle to Ladbrokes¡¯ 

takeover of the company , according to the Sunday Times . 

AIM - listed <ORG> GVC </ORG> revealed in August that it was in exclusive talks to buy <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> ¡¯s <MISC> Turkish </MISC> - language website . 

A disposal of the business would pave the way for Ladbrokes to buy <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> to strengthen its online offering . 

<ORG> Ladbrokes </ORG> has been in talks with <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> since June , but the business in <LOC> Turkey </LOC> , where unlicensed websites are illegal , was seen by analysts as a stumbling block . 

The high - street bookmaker , which has until Oct. 17 to table a bid for <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> , has pulled out of previous deals because of its aversion to operating in unregulated territories . 

A spokesman for <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> said talks with both companies were ongoing . 

<MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Rickie Fowler </PER> won his first professional golf title with a six - stroke victory over <MISC> U.S. Open </MISC> champion <PER> Rory McIlroy </PER> in the <MISC> Korea Open </MISC> in Cheonan on Sunday . 

The long - haired Californian , one of golf ¡¯s most exciting young prospects , carded a three - under - par 68 in the final round at the <LOC> Woo Jeong Hills Country </LOC> Club for a four - day total of 16-under 268 . 

I played well early on in the final round 

and then I was comfortable over the last few holes . 

Overall , I enjoyed the whole week , ¡± the 22-year - <PER> old Fowler </PER> told reporters . 

World number three <PER> McIlroy </PER> , tied for fourth overnight , clinched second spot with a superb closing round of seven - under 64 , ahead of <LOC> South Korea </LOC> ¡¯s <PER> Kim Meen </PER> - <PER> whee </PER> and compatriot <PER> Y.E. Yang </PER> , third and fourth respectively . 

It feels great to have the first win , ¡± said <PER> Fowler </PER> . 

I played well all week , although I did have to hang in on Friday and post a score . 

But on Thursday , Saturday and Sunday I had good control of my ball , I drove well and I made some putts . ¡± 

<PER> Fowler </PER> never slipped from the top of the leaderboard over the four days and said his consistency was the main factor behind his first title . 

¡° I ¡¯m happy with the way I have played on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> , but I have never shot low enough to win , ¡± he added . 

This week I played well for four rounds which I have not been able to do in the past . 

Winning a title on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> and a place in the <MISC> Ryder Cup </MISC> team would top his agenda for next year , he said . 

¡° I am looking forward to some time off 

and then I can look at everything and set some goals for next year . 

I will play mainly on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> next year 

and I would like to get my first win there , and this win will definitely help me achieve that . 

¡° I also have n¡¯t made the Tour Championship in the last two years , so that is another goal for next year . 

But the biggest goal is to make sure I make the <MISC> Ryder Cup </MISC> team . ¡± 

Northern <PER> Irishman McIlroy </PER> said he had been happy with his finish but added : ¡° All the damage was done during the third round with a couple of bad holes in the middle of the round . 

¡° Looking back on this week , I will rue my third round , which could have been a lot better . 

¡° If I had played a little better and shot a few under I might have had a chance , but <PER> Rickie </PER> has played fantastic this week and he deserves the win .

A <MISC> Greek </MISC> default would have unforeseeable consequences and cause the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone crisis to spread , <ORG> European Commission </ORG> President <PER> Jose Manuel Barroso </PER> was quoted as saying in mass - selling <ORG> Bild </ORG> daily . 

Talks are continuing over a vital aid tranche for debt - stricken <LOC> Athens </LOC> , which could run out of cash as soon as mid - November , dragging the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone deeper into a debt crisis already shaking financial markets worldwide . 

¡° If we give up on <LOC> Greece </LOC> , there is a big danger that the crisis will spread to other countries , ¡± <PER> Barroso </PER> told <ORG> Bild </ORG> in an interview to be published on Monday , echoing comments of <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> . 

<PER> Merkel </PER> warned last week the threat of contagion from a <MISC> euro </MISC> zone state rescheduling its debt would be huge and only made sense once it had achieved a primary surplus . 

<PER> Barroso </PER> noted the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone had no experience with the possible bankruptcy of a member state . 

This is new territory for us and we are discussing solutions which have not really been tested before , ¡± he said . 

But the <ORG> European Union </ORG> was convinced that a <MISC> Greek </MISC> bankruptcy was ¡° not cheaper for all participants than the current aid schemes , ¡± he said . 

<MISC> European </MISC> finance ministers are considering making banks take bigger losses on <MISC> Greek </MISC> debt ¡ª an issue that could be discussed at a meeting between <PER> Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> later on Sunday . 

It is still uncertain whether <LOC> Greece </LOC> , which was hit by strikes and riots over austerity measures last week , will receive the next tranche of aid given doubts over its willingness to reform . 

¡° The reforms must be faster , otherwise <LOC> Greece </LOC> will lose its credibility , ¡± said <PER> Barroso </PER> . 

<PER> Barroso </PER> added that <LOC> Europe </LOC> needed to correct the ¡° orgy of consumption ¡± that had taken place in some countries due to the introduction of a strong common currency with low interest rates . 

<PER> Merkel </PER> meets with <PER> Sarkozy </PER> on Sunday to thrash out differences over how to use the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s financial firepower to counter the debt crisis , which is threatening to spiral into financial meltdown as the value of banks¡¯ sovereign debt holdings slide . 

A unit of state - owned freight company <ORG> Transnet </ORG> opened a line to transport magnetite for export , after disruptions caused by damage to a bridge , the company said in a statement late on Saturday . 

The <LOC> Brakspruit bridge </LOC> in the country ¡¯s <LOC> Limpopo </LOC> province was damaged last year . 

<ORG> Transnet </ORG> had measures in place to minimise the impact of disruptions and exports were not significantly affected . 

<ORG> Transnet </ORG> Freight Rail opened the <LOC> Phalaborwa </LOC> - <LOC> Hoedspruit </LOC> railway on Saturday and is transporting at a yearly rate of 4 million tons . 

¡° <ORG> Transnet </ORG> boasts a record of 1.9 million tons achieved in the first six months of the current financial year . 

This is 46 percent more than what was achieved during the same period last year , ¡± the company said . 

<ORG> Transnet </ORG> said it has set a target of achieving 10 

million tons in five years . 

<ORG> Transnet </ORG> transports commodities such as coal and iron 

ore from mines to export terminals and sends fuel from coastal

<LOC> BERLIN </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Greece </LOC> is at a crossroads and will need to implement ¡° much stricter structural reforms ¡± than seen so far , IMF mission chief to <LOC> Greece </LOC> Poul <PER> Thomsen </PER> was quoted as saying by a <MISC> German </MISC> paper on Saturday . 

The gloomy comments suggested the IMF was still unsure whether current talks on a vital aid tranche for <LOC> Athens </LOC> would conclude positively , given doubts over <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s willingness to reform and the impact of <MISC> Greek </MISC> strikes and riots . 

¡° <LOC> Greece </LOC> is at a crossroads , ¡± he was quoted as saying by <ORG> Welt am Sonntag </ORG> . 

It is clear the programme will not work if the authorities do not take the path that requires much stricter structural reforms than those that we have seen so far . ¡± 

The IMF on Friday dismissed a statement by the <MISC> Greek </MISC> government that the deal on aid was already completed . 

It is going two steps forward , and one backwards , ¡± <PER> Thomsen </PER> said . 

The <MISC> Greek </MISC> government understands that many of the most difficult changes lie ahead . 

At the same time , the political and social fatigue is growing . ¡± 

<LOC> Athens </LOC> could run out of cash as soon as mid - November without the new eight billion <MISC> euro </MISC> aid installment , increasing the risk of a default that would drag the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone deeper into a debt crisis already shaking financial markets worldwide . 

Inspectors from the IMF , the <ORG> European Commission </ORG> and the <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> ¡ª known as the <ORG> troika </ORG> ¡ª resumed last week their review of <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s progress under a multi - billion <MISC> euro </MISC> bailout , after leaving <LOC> Athens </LOC> four weeks before over disagreements on how to put its finances back on track . 

The <MISC> Greeks </MISC> believe it is enough to make laws , ¡± the <ORG> EU Commission </ORG> ¡¯s <PER> Matthias Mors </PER> told the <ORG> Welt am Sonntag </ORG> . 

And often the right structures are lacking , for example in tax administration . 

A senior <ORG> troika </ORG> official told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> on Wednesday that the inspectors were likely to give the green light to the aid but that it was not assured . 

The <ORG> EU </ORG> and IMF first want to receive more details on the implementation and impact of plans announced last month to slash the public sector workforce and increase taxes to plug a bigger - than - targeted fiscal gap , the official said . 

Talks between <LOC> Greece </LOC> and the <ORG> troika </ORG> will continue on Sunday , focusing on the country ¡¯s deficit cut plan for 2013 and 2014 , a <ORG> finance ministry </ORG> official said on condition of anonymity after a further , four - hour negotiating round between Finance Minister <PER> Evangelos Venizelos </PER> and the <ORG> EU </ORG> / IMF inspectors . 

<LOC> Athens </LOC> shocked financial markets by announcing that it would miss 2011 deficit targets set as conditions of a bailout aimed at staving off bankruptcy , despite a series of tax hikes and spending cuts . 

<PER> Thomsen </PER> said he had never seen riots against austerity measures as intense as in <LOC> Greece </LOC> . 

¡° People express their frustration sometimes in very unpleasant ways , ¡± he said . 

That is one of the ugly aspects of my work . 

And the intensity of it here is new for me . 

<ORG> EU </ORG> leaders will meet in <LOC> Brussels </LOC> on October 17 - 18 to discuss revising a July 21 deal to provide <LOC> Greece </LOC> with a second rescue package . 

They may ask investors to accept losses on their holdings of <MISC> Greek </MISC> debt even larger than the 21 percent write - down set out in the July deal . 

A leading member of <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> ¡¯s conservatives told a paper on Saturday <LOC> Greece </LOC> was near bankruptcy and must give up part of its sovereignty to obtain the large debt forgiveness it needs to survive . 

<PER> Michael Fuchs </PER> , a deputy parliamentary floor leader for <PER> Merkel </PER> ¡¯s 

<ORG> Christian Democrats </ORG> ( <ORG> CDU </ORG> ) , also told <MISC> Greek </MISC> newspaper ¡° Real News ¡± that the debt - laden country might be better off outside the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone .

<ORG> Deutsche Telekom </ORG> is confident of selling its T - <ORG> Mobile USA </ORG> unit to <ORG> AT&T </ORG> despite an antitrust lawsuit by the Obama administration to bloc the deal , <ORG> Deutsche Telekom </ORG> ¡¯s chief executive told a <MISC> German </MISC> newspaper . 

The suit came as a surprise to everyone , for the professional world as well as both sides , ¡± <PER> Rene Obermann </PER> told <ORG> Bild am Sonntag </ORG> newspaper in an interview . 

But we are pushing forward determinedly with the project and are optimistic that in the end we will be able to carry out this merger , ¡± <PER> Obermann </PER> added . 

The sale of T - mobile is likely to spur activity in the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> mobile phone market , <ORG> Obermann </ORG> said . 

¡° It will fire up competition in the <LOC> United States </LOC> because it will boost network capacity and that is the basis for price competition , ¡± he said . 

The merger creates advantages for all participants and that is why it will go through , I remain very confident of it . ¡± 

The <ORG> U.S. Justice Department </ORG> has sued to block <ORG> AT&T </ORG> ¡¯s $ 39 billion purchase of T - Mobile over worries it would squelch competition and innovation as well as lead to higher prices . 

A key government concern is that T - Mobile , the No . 4 wireless carrier , generally costs less than other carriers so its disappearance could mean higher prices for wireless service . 

T - Mobile and <ORG> AT&T </ORG> , the No . 2 wireless carrier that would vault to market leader if the sale goes through , have sought to address the government ¡¯s concerns and negotiate a settlement in which the deal could be completed .

Its operations were to be transferred at the weekend to a new subsidiary under Finansiel Stabilitet , the state authority set up to handle failed <MISC> Danish </MISC> banks , <PER> Finansiel Stabilitet </PER> said in a statement late Saturday . 

It would be the 10th bank to fall into state hands since the start of the financial crisis in 2008 . 

The transfer of operations will be made under a recent adjustment to an existing government bank aid package , and the transfer would be effective on October 8 , <PER> Finansiel Stabilitet </PER> said . 

The bank would still be able to service its customers , <PER> Finansiel Stabilitet </PER> said . 

Last month , <MISC> Danish </MISC> political parties agreed to adjust a bank aid package to help the <MISC> Nordic </MISC> country ¡¯s smaller liquidity - squeezed banks and promote mergers within the sector . 

The agreement followed growing worries that more small <MISC> Danish </MISC> banks could fail . 

But it has offered little guarantee to creditors , which has contributed to a shortage of international funding to all but a handful of the country ¡¯s biggest banks . 

Also last month , <LOC> Denmark </LOC> ¡¯s central bank threw a lifeline to the country ¡¯s liquidity - squeezed banks by offering a new six - month loan based on its main lending rate and expanding the scope of collateral that it accepts from banks . 

<ORG> Max Bank </ORG> reported a net loss of 60.3 million <MISC> Danish </MISC> crowns ( $ 10.8 million ) in the first half of the year following 79.2 million crowns of write downs , but kept its 2011 outlook of a 80 million to 100 million crowns profit .

Premier League club <ORG> Fulham </ORG> plan to increase the capacity at their picturesque <LOC> Craven Cottage </LOC> ground from 25,700 to 30,000 , officials said . 

¡° <ORG> Fulham </ORG> has seen unprecedented success both on and off the pitch in recent years , and is now an established Premier League club , qualifying for <MISC> European </MISC> competitions and accommodating over 25,000 people on a regular basis , ¡± the club ¡¯s chief executive <PER> Alistair Mackintosh </PER> said in a statement on their website ( www.fulhamfc.com ) . 

¡° We are confident a redevelopment will improve the fans matchday experience ... whilst remaining sympathetic to the design of this historic ground . 

<ORG> Fulham </ORG> have played at the Cottage by the banks of the <LOC> River Thames </LOC> , regarded as one of the most attractive and traditional grounds in <LOC> England </LOC> , since 1896 . 

Last week <PER> Chelsea </PER> , who play at <LOC> Stamford Bridge </LOC> , two kilometres from <LOC> Craven Cottage </LOC> , said they were looking at options to move from the ground which has been their home since they were formed in 1905 . 

<MISC> Argentine </MISC> President <PER> Cristina Fernandez </PER> has a massive lead over opponents two weeks before a presidential election and looks set to win more than 50 percent of the vote , two polls showed on Sunday . 

<PER> Fernandez </PER> ¡¯s support now stands at 53.2 percent , according to the latest monthly survey by local pollsters Management & Fit showed . 

That puts her more than 40 points ahead of her nearest rival , Socialist provincial governor <PER> Hermes Binner </PER> . 

A Poliarquia poll for leading daily <ORG> La Nacion </ORG> gave support of 49.3 percent but a projected vote of between 52 percent and 55 percent considering voters who are still undecided . 

Center - leftist <PER> Fernandez </PER> won just over 50 percent of votes in an August primary , which was seen as a dress rehearsal for the October 23 election because all parties had already anointed their candidates and voters could choose among them . 

<PER> Binner </PER> has voter support of 12.4 percent , up from 11.6 percent last month and consolidating his position as <PER> Fernandez </PER> ¡¯s nearest rival , Management & Fit ¡¯s survey showed . 

The Poliarquia poll also put <PER> Binner </PER> in second place with support of 13.6 percent and a projected vote of between 14 percent and 16 percent . 

Trailing in third in both polls was <PER> Ricardo Alfonsin </PER> , a social <MISC> democratic </MISC> legislator , who had support of 7.8 percent and 9.5 percent in the polls . 

Management & Fit ¡¯s survey showed <LOC> San Luis </LOC> provincial governor <PER> Alberto Rodriguez Saa </PER> fourth on 7.4 percent while Poliarquia ¡¯s poll gave him support of 8.2 percent . 

<PER> Rodriguez Saa </PER> is a dissident member of <PER> Fernandez </PER> ¡¯s <ORG> Peronist party </ORG> . 

<PER> Fernandez </PER> , who chose Economy Minister <PER> Amado Boudou </PER> as her vice presidential candidate , vows to continue current policies that include a strong state hand in the economy , hefty energy and transportation subsidies and trade protectionism . 

She is enjoying approval ratings of more than 60 percent thanks to brisk economic growth , the opposition ¡¯s failure to mount a convincing challenge and public sympathy following the death a year ago of her husband and predecessor as president , <PER> Nestor Kirchner </PER> . 

Under <MISC> Argentine </MISC> election law , candidates are guaranteed a first - round victory if they win more than 45 percent of votes . 

The Management & Fit poll was taken between October 1 and October 5 among 2,031 people . 

The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points and 10.2 percent of respondents said they did not know or did not answer . 

<ORG> Poliarquia ¡¯s </ORG> poll had a margin of error of 2.7 points and surveyed 1,400 people .

He wanted a regular role on the series , one that would let him explore all of his character 's many secrets . 

The decision to make him the show 's central villain has resulted in its most tense , jittery , and brilliant storylines . 

This season , it divided longtime partners <PER> Walter White </PER> ( <PER> Bryan Cranston </PER> ) and <PER> Jesse Pinkman </PER> ( <PER> Aaron Paul </PER> ) .

<PER> Bryan Cranston </PER> on ' Breaking Bad ' Season Finale : ' 

Among the discoveries about <PER> Gus </PER> this season : He 's driven in part by trying to avenge the death of his former partner , <PER> Max </PER> . 

We talked to him about Sunday 's season finale for television 's best show , how he expanded the character , and whether <PER> Gus </PER> 's relationship with <PER> Max </PER> went beyond business and friendship . 

The episode " <ORG> Hermanos </ORG> , " where we finally got a glimpse into <PER> Gus </PER> ' background and what motivates him , is one of the series ' best . 

It also left some viewers wondering about the nature of <PER> Gus </PER> 's relationship with <PER> Max </PER> , the man <PER> Tio </PER> murdered right in front him . " 

Breaking Bad " creator <PER> Vince Gilligan </PER> says it 's up to viewers to decide , but what 's your take ? 

Were <PER> Gus </PER> and <PER> Max friends </PER> so close that they were like brothers , <LOC> hermanos </LOC> ? 

I think the magic of really good television is to allow the audience to draw their own conclusion . 

Certainly , there is a deep and abiding love between <PER> Gus </PER> and <PER> Max </PER> . 

You 've got to make up your own mind to see if it was .

I was born in <LOC> Copenhagen </LOC> , raised in <LOC> Italy </LOC> . 

My father 's <MISC> Italian </MISC> , my <PER> mother </PER> 's black . 

My father kissed me on the lips my whole life , or cheek to cheek . 

Is that looked at oddly in <LOC> America </LOC> ? 

I would think that <PER> Gus </PER> has those same sensibilities . 

I would go for the professional aspect of it , to be honest with you , that he really cares about another human being . 

Being that this is a guy he took off the street , put through school and trained him to be a chemist , to have his life dream come true , even though it played into what <PER> Gus </PER> wanted , is more important than whether they were lovers or not . 

Could they very possibly have been sleeping together ? 

I mean , <PER> James Martinez </PER> ( the actor who played <PER> Max </PER> ) is a beautiful man . 

He plays the role so beautifully and seamlessly that it allowed all of those thoughts to happen . 

I think that 's what makes it great . 

To label it , to name it , to know , I think it 's much less interesting . 

It 's certainly and surely possible . 

Would it have been possible if they got a really ugly actor to play that guy ? 

How defined was the character of <PER> Gus </PER> when you signed on for the show ? 

Was it written on the page that you would play him as this deliberate man , or did you make all these choices about how to portray him ? 

I hate to take all of the credit for what I do , because the writing is so stellar and I pay such close attention to everything that 's written , including the stage directions . 

I come from theater and they say , ' Do n't read the stage directions . ' 

In ' Breaking Bad , ' I read every stage direction , because I think everything really is information for me to take further . 

In the beginning , it was n't defined . 

He appeared to be the manager of this chicken restaurant , but I always read into it that he was keeping a very big secret , even if he was n't . 

They did n't know if I was going to go more than one guest spot episode or two . 

I think if you ask <PER> Vince Gilligan </PER> , they did n't think that I would go four . 

That was n't in their consciousness . 

Read more : ' Breaking Bad ' : 5 Questions Answered in the Season Premiere 

How did the character become integral to the story ? 

What happened was that I was asked to do that guest spot . 

Within a couple of days of me finishing the first one , they said , ' Would you come back and do the season ender ? ' 

Then they came back and said , ' Would you do more ? ' 

I said yeah , I would , but not as a guest star . 

They asked me to do seven more guest spots , and I said , ' No , I 'm not interested in that . 

I 'm interested in really finding out who this character is . ' 

I prefaced all of that by saying that I loved the show . 

I adore and think that <PER> Vince Gilligan </PER> is brilliant . 

But I do n't want to just come in and out ¡­ 

I want to come in and have a full canvas to work with , and I expressed that . 

I wound up doing 11 , which was a clear indication ¡­ of their trust and devotion to doing what I previously had asked for , which was to be able to create a complete character and to be part of a family . 

But again , <PER> Gus </PER> was just a nice guy who worked in the chicken joint , who probably had some secrets , and they were hoping to uncover some of that . 

I am in gratitude that they found , through my performance , that they would like to uncover a whole lot more . 

Which they definitely did , especially , as we discussed , in the " Hermanos " episode . 

It was so satisfying for viewers to get a glimpse at what motivates <PER> Gus </PER> ¡­ 

did you feel that way , too , when you read the script ? 

I 've done other shows and other series , and they go along , and you have a dual thing going on , where you want to be able to be on something that 's quality , and to make some money and feed your family . 

Then , once ( your character ) gets your office or your home , you know you 're going to be around for a while . 

You 're like , ' Yay , they 're not going to write me out . 

With this ( episode ) , the triumph was that they asked me for some family pictures . 

I brought in pictures of my four daughters and put them all on the wall . 

( Viewers ) never really saw them , but just in case one day they did and wanted to reflect back to that scene , they could see my family , which meant ( <PER> Gus </PER> ) could have a wife . 

other ¡­ I could be living like <PER> Gus </PER> does in plain sight , but have the trimmings of the whole family . 

But , yes , for people to see the background of a character that you create and understand ¡­ because a lot of our villains that we experience , in many ways they 're one note . 

I certainly did n't want to have <PER> Gus </PER> be that .

What truly motivates <PER> Gus </PER> , especially going forward , now that he 's got his revenge on <PER> Don Eladio </PER> and <PER> Tio </PER> ? 

I think that what motivates <PER> Gus </PER> for much of what we 've seen has been revenge , building his empire , playing his cards right . 

But since that really horrible moment that we finally see in ( " Hermanos " ) , we understand him a different way . 

It 's not only revenge , but the revenge has played into taking over , into making this family his family . 

I think if we were to go back even further than that , we 'd see his connection to the Pinochet government and where all the previous incarnations of <PER> Gus </PER> came from and what his dream for his empire is . 

We have n't seen that yet , but I think the motivation is a two - fold motivation . 

It 's to bring people to their best selves in whatever they do , which is why he has such patience for <PER> Jesse </PER> , who is a ne'er?do?well drug addict . 

And , I have to say , what moves <PER> Gus </PER> is the family . 

It 's outlined in <PER> Gus </PER> ' " a man provides " speech to <PER> Walt </PER> . 

You do the hard things that you have to do , some of them you will not want to do , to take care of your family . 

Yeah , you 've got cancer and you 're dying . 

Live the rest of your life and croak , like a man . 

Read more : ' Breaking Bad , ' the Comedy ? ! 

That is what <PER> Gus </PER> would do , how he would play it . 

I really , really feel like that 's his motivation . 

He wants to bring people to their best selves . 

He wants to teach people how to be in control and have self?control . 

He wants to teach people how to be successful and he wants to allow them to be smart . 

<PER> Walt </PER> has missed the boat , in terms of understanding that little good piece of what <PER> Gus </PER> is trying to display . 

As viewers , as crazy as it sounds , we 're actually kind of rooting for <PER> Gus </PER> . 

Despite everything he 's done , the box cutter murder of his assistant , the threats to <PER> Walt </PER> 's whole family , and what we know he 's capable of ¡­ 

If that 's the case , and I 've been told that by others , then that means I 've done my job really well . 

Because if in one week , you 're really hoping that <PER> Jesse </PER> takes that ricin cigarette and puts it in this food and kills <PER> Gus </PER> , then in the very next episode <PER> Gus </PER> stands down the cartel and you 're like , " Yeah ! " because those guys are worse than he is ( laughing ) 

I 'm a thoughtful person , and I want to be challenged . 

If you can go then , from one episode feeling like , ' Oh , <PER> gosh </PER> , I want him to be dead , ' and then in the next episode going , ' Wow , that was a great move . 

I 'm really glad he did that , ' it plays into my theory that nothing 's really black and white . 

There are some gray areas in life for all of us . ' 

Breaking Bad ' truly is a show where you can really play with that and display it . 

Have the opportunity to really move into that gray area in a wonderful way . 

The season four finale airs on Sunday ¡­ have you looked ahead at the next season yet ? 

Do you want to know anything about it at this point ? 

I do n't really want to know and I know that <PER> Vince </PER> does n't know . 

It 's interesting , because I 've read what he 's talked about , and I know from before we even finished season four , people were asking . 

<PER> Vince </PER> has already stated , he told me two years ago , that he only thought it was a five?year series , because there 's a lot to wind up . 

He 's got to wind up <PER> Hank </PER> , finding out or not finding out . 

He 's got to wind up all these different little aspects of this piece . 

I think a good storyteller acknowledges that there 's a beginning , middle and end . 

I think it 's going to be a discovery for him , as it will be for us , and I do n't want to know right now . 

I just want to bask in the energy of this really pretty incredible fourth season and see what he comes up with for the fifth . 

Read more : ' Breaking Bad 's ' <PER> Anna Gunn </PER> : 

So , without spoiling the major events of the season finale , just tell us what we should expect from it ? 

<LOC> Oh </LOC> , I think you 've got to expect some very explosive confrontation . 

¡­ ' Breaking Bad ' is so good at leaving the show in a very impolite way . 

They leave you in an impolite way , because you 've got to wait another year to see it . 

I can guarantee you it 's going to be good , quite , quite powerful , and will really give you pause to think about how television is made . 

This show is organic , truthful and real . 

There is not a false beat , not a false moment . 

This last episode is a culmination of everything that they 've tried to do with ' Breaking Bad ' over the years , so it 's pretty fabulous . 

The " Breaking Bad " season four finale airs Sunday at 10/9c on <ORG> AMC </ORG> .

<LOC> BERLIN </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - A <MISC> Greek </MISC> default would have unforeseeable consequences and cause the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone crisis to spread , <ORG> European Commission </ORG> President <PER> Jose Manuel Barroso </PER> was quoted as saying in mass - selling <ORG> Bild </ORG> daily . 

Talks are continuing over a vital aid tranche for debt - stricken <LOC> Athens </LOC> , which could run out of cash as soon as mid - November , dragging the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone deeper into a debt crisis already shaking financial markets worldwide .

<PER> Merkel </PER> warned last week the threat of contagion from a <MISC> euro </MISC> zone state rescheduling its debt would be huge and only made sense once it had achieved a primary surplus . 

<PER> Barroso </PER> noted the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone had no experience with the possible bankruptcy of a member state . 

This is new territory for us and we are discussing solutions which have not really been tested before , ¡± he said . 

But the <ORG> European Union </ORG> was convinced that a <MISC> Greek </MISC> bankruptcy was ¡° not cheaper for all participants than the current aid schemes , ¡± he said .

¡° The reforms must be faster , otherwise <LOC> Greece </LOC> will lose its credibility , ¡± said <PER> Barroso </PER> . 

<PER> Barroso </PER> added that <LOC> Europe </LOC> needed to correct the ¡° orgy of consumption ¡± that had taken place in some countries due to the introduction of a strong common currency with low interest rates .

The new investor will partner with state - run <ORG> Israel Electric Corp </ORG> ( <ORG> IEC </ORG> ) to form a private company that will build and operate the network using the utility ¡¯s infrastructure . 

It will have a 51 percent stake in the new company to be formed by April 2012 . 

<ORG> IEC </ORG> ¡¯s <PER> Tzvi Harpak </PER> , who heads the tender committee , said the project will cost billions of shekels and will include some 25,000 km of optic fibers that will provide <MISC> internet </MISC> access at 100 megabits per second . 

About 65 percent of the country will be covered in the first seven years and the rest by 2020 , he said . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> ¡¯s telecom sector has a relatively small amount of players and the government is under increasing pressure to add competition and lower prices . 

Communication Minister <PER> Moshe Kahlon </PER> has already taken aim at the cellular phone market in the past year by awarding licences to two new operators and allowing the entry of mobile virtual network operators . 

<PER> Kahlon </PER> said on Sunday the telecom infrastructure field ¡° is in need of a new player ¡± . 

Currently only two companies run <MISC> internet </MISC> infrastructures ¡ª telephone operator <ORG> Bezeq </ORG> and cable company HOT 

. 

<PER> Yiftah Ron </PER> - <PER> Tal </PER> , chairman of the board at <ORG> IEC </ORG> , said the fiber optic project will bring in new revenues at a time when his company is in ¡° a very tough financial situation ¡± . 

The <ORG> IEC </ORG> has run into financial difficulties due to extra costs for fuel stemming from a halt in natural gas from <LOC> Egypt </LOC> , forcing the company to turn to more expensive alternatives . 

<LOC> JOHANNESBURG </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - High - ranking officials of <LOC> South Africa </LOC> ¡¯s ruling <ORG> ANC </ORG> visited <LOC> China </LOC> this week , local media reported on Sunday , in what could be seen as the party ¡¯s unreserved support for <LOC> Beijing </LOC> . 

<ORG> African National Congress </ORG> ( <ORG> ANC </ORG> ) officials were not immediately available to confirm reports in two newspapers ¡ª the City Press and Sunday Independent ¡ª that party representatives went to <LOC> China </LOC> . 

The visit came after <LOC> South Africa </LOC> delayed a visa application for the <PER> Dalai Lama </PER> , who was to visit the country to celebrate <MISC> Nobel Peace Prize </MISC> winner <PER> Desmond Tutu </PER> ¡¯s birthday . 

<ORG> ANC </ORG> supporters , leading newspapers and <PER> Tutu </PER> said the move was symbolic of the failings of the party that helped end apartheid but was now failing to live up to the ideals of the <ORG> liberation movement </ORG> it had once been . 

<LOC> China </LOC> has labelled the <PER> Dalai Lama </PER> a dangerous separatist and analysts said <LOC> Pretoria </LOC> bowed to pressure from its largest trading partner to bar the <MISC> Tibetan </MISC> spiritual leader from visiting , damaging its reputation in the process . 

Two weeks ago , <LOC> China </LOC> pledged to invest $ 2.5 billion in <LOC> South Africa </LOC> during a visit to <LOC> Beijing </LOC> by Deputy President <PER> Kgalema Motlanthe </PER> . 

The City Press said <ORG> ANC </ORG> Secretary - General <PER> Gwede Mantashe </PER> , high - ranking official <PER> Jessie Duarte </PER> , deputy economic development minister <PER> Enoch Godongwana </PER> and other party officials had spent the week in <LOC> China </LOC> on an exchange programme with the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> Communist Party . 

<PER> Paul Mashatile </PER> was quoted in the City Press as saying the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> governing party had offered to ¡° teach the <ORG> ANC </ORG> about politics ¡± . 

In a video link with <LOC> Cape Town </LOC> , the <PER> Dalai Lama </PER> on Saturday said <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s officials were hypocrites whose regime was built on lies . 

* Output at <LOC> Rumaila South </LOC> back to 460,000 bpd 

* Normal production of 650,000 seen Monday 

<LOC> BASRA </LOC> , <LOC> Iraq </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Iraq </LOC> ¡¯s Rumaila South oilfield output has been restored to 460,000 barrels per day after pipeline bombings last week and normal production of about 650,000 bpd is expected to start on Monday , the head of <ORG> Rumaila </ORG> operations told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> on Sunday . 

¡° Two production stations were restarted this morning to start pumping 460,000 bpd to Zubair storage and two more stations will be operating this afternoon , ¡± said <PER> Salah Abdul </PER> - <PER> Kareem </PER> . 

<PER> Abdul </PER> - <PER> Kareem </PER> said output from <LOC> Rumaila South </LOC> is expected to increase gradually to hit around 650,000 bpd on Monday . 

<LOC> Rumaila North </LOC> has a normal production of around 540,000 bpd . 

Exports from <LOC> Basra </LOC> were at around 2 million bpd on Sunday compared with 1.58 million bpd on Saturday , a Basra shipping source told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

Oil production at <LOC> Iraq </LOC> ¡¯s Rumaila oilfield had been cut by 700,000 barrels per day from about 1.24 million bpd after two bombs on Friday halted some of its production . 

BP , developing Rumaila along with <ORG> China National Petroleum Corp. </ORG> , said on Saturday it had to stop some of the production from the Rumaila oilfield after <ORG> SOC </ORG> requested it . 

<ORG> Rumaila </ORG> , the workhorse of <LOC> Iraq </LOC> ¡¯s oil industry , has estimated reserves of around 17 billion barrels and produces the bulk of <LOC> Iraq </LOC> ¡¯s total output of 2.9 million bpd now . 

<ORG> Oshkosh Corp </ORG> turned down a new five - year contract offer from the company for a second time in little more than a week on Saturday even after union leaders narrowed differences between the two sides in recent days . 

About 63 percent of hourly employees working in northeast <LOC> Wisconsin </LOC> plants represented by the <ORG> United Auto Workers union </ORG> voted to reject the contract , UAW Local 578 President <PER> Nick Nitschke </PER> said in an email to <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

The company ¡¯s desire to work with the UAW on future hiring of temporary workers remains a key sticking point , he said . 

The UAW and <ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> plan to resume bargaining in the near future . 

<ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> spokesman <PER> John Daggett </PER> said in a statement that production employees will report to work on Monday at their normal work schedules and there will be no interruption in production . 

UAW - represented workers at <LOC> Oshkosh </LOC> , totaling 3,000 more than employees , rejected <ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> ¡¯s first contract offer on September 30 even though that meant losing a $ 2,000 signing bonus . 

Company and union officials spent the past week negotiating a new deal that included reworded language on seniority and temporary workers , and a revised financial package . 

<ORG> Oshkosh </ORG> is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of military , fire and emergency and commercial vehicles . 

The labor talks are being closely watched by investors and analysts who have been concerned about the company ¡¯s exposure to a defense sector that is under pressure . 

Tension over temporary workers is not the only problem still left to resolve . 

The company ¡¯s move to increase its pay - raise offer from 8 percent in the original contract offer to 8.5 percent through 2016 

¡° did n¡¯t fly with higher insurance costs , ¡± <PER> Nitschke </PER> said .

It ¡¯s shocking , but movies are of secondary concern in ¡° Life Itself , ¡± the new memoir from <PER> Roger Ebert </PER> . 

Yes , the book features anecdotes from years spent churning out reviews of classics such as ¡° <MISC> Bonnie and Clyde ¡± and ¡° Boyz ¡® N The Hood ¡± </MISC> and boasts amusing remembrances of film greats like the hard - drinking <PER> Lee Marvin </PER> and a ¡° damned if I care ¡± <PER> Robert Mitchum </PER> . 

But readers hoping for an in - the - trenches account from <LOC> Ebert ¡¯s </LOC> decades as one of the nation ¡¯s taste - makers will be disappointed . 

Instead , <LOC> America </LOC> ¡¯s most famous film critic offers an over - stocked tour through his early life as the only child of an electrician , his struggles with alcoholism , his love affair and eventual marriage to his wife , <PER> Chaz </PER> , and his battle with cancer ¡ª- a fight that robbed him of the ability to speak , eat and drink , while leaving him , in his own words , looking like ¡° the Phantom of the Opera . ¡± 

There are also odes to the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> - based fast food chain Steak ¡® N Shake , loving accounts of travel to foreign cities such as <LOC> London </LOC> and <LOC> Venice </LOC> , riffs on secular humanism , and a chronicle of lost virginity involving a prostitute in <LOC> South Africa </LOC> . 

Even boyhood dog <PER> Blackie </PER> gets a chapter . 

At the end of it , you ¡¯ll know more about Ebert than you do your closest friends , and that ¡¯s not always a good thing . 

Though the prose is crisp and the stories , like <ORG> Ebert ¡¯s best </ORG> reviews , glide effortlessly without ever calling attention to the writing , it ¡¯s hard to shake the feeling that some of what ¡¯s recounted could have benefited from the red pen and that the most interesting bits were left on the cutting - room floor . 

" Life Itself " is generous , witty , and warm - hearted , but it ¡¯s also a bit rudderless . 

<PER> Ebert </PER> ¡¯s unflinching account of his struggles with alcoholism is admirable , as is his dignity in coping with the surgeries that mangled his face and robbed him of his voice , but the book takes off when he describes his career critiquing movies . 

The emotional highpoint is not when he finally gives up the bottle or accepts his medical condition , but in his loving tribute to Gene Siskel , his co - anchor on a weekly <MISC> review series ¡° Siskel & Ebert </MISC> : 

The tall , relatively slender , and private Siskel , who died of a brain tumor in 1999 , was the physical and temperamental opposite of the squat , portly , and effusive <PER> Ebert </PER> . 

Yet the two shared an improbable on - screen chemistry that worked off - screen , too . 

Part of the fun of their pairing were the moments when the two parted ways on a movie and would engage in full - throated debates about a film ¡¯s merits . 

That combativeness , <PER> Ebert writes </PER> , almost inspired a sitcom about two rival critics joined in a love / hate relationship , but both CBS and <ORG> Disney </ORG> ultimately took a pass on the pitch . 

Maybe the problem was that no one else could possibly understand how meaningless was the hate , how deep was the love , ¡± <PER> Ebert writes </PER> . 

Love forms the spine of <MISC> Ebert ¡¯s memoir ¡ª love </MISC> for his emotionally crippling mother , love for his former bar - mates and fellow newspaper hounds , and love for <PER> Chaz </PER> , the woman who has been a guardian angel , fiercely protective of his business interests and his medical care . 

It also appears , in an all - too - brief account of what films <ORG> excite Ebert </ORG> , in which he recounts what makes a memorable film . 

He does n¡¯t have a precise formula , mixing in everything from the joyful physical movement that defines 

¡° Singing in the Rain ¡± to the great dialogue that bubbles up during the first 30 minutes of ¡° White Men 

but 

it seems to boil down to you know it when you see it . 

¡° When you go to the movies every day , it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever , more craven and cowardly , more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes instead of educating them , ¡± <PER> Ebert writes </PER> . 

Then you see something absolutely miraculous , and on your way out you look distracted , as if you had just experienced some kind of a vision . ¡±

Just 12 percent were in favor of the current coalition of conservatives and pro - <ORG> business Free Democrats </ORG> ( <MISC> FDP </MISC> ) .

<PER> Merkel </PER> ¡¯s <ORG> CDU </ORG> is working on its vision for <LOC> Europe </LOC> , <ORG> Spiegel </ORG> magazine wrote , quoting a draft of a policy paper for the party ¡¯s November conference . 

According to this draft , the <ORG> CDU </ORG> wants more <LOC> Europe </LOC> , namely a ¡° completion of the currency union ¡± through greater economic integration . 

The <MISC> euro </MISC> zone should also have a restructuring procedure for members that are unable to fulfill the conditions for a stable common currency despite increased incentives .

Meanwhile , the <ORG> CSU </ORG> and <ORG> FDP </ORG> are discussing their <MISC> European </MISC> strategies separately and taking a tougher stance on bailout aid , making it difficult for <PER> Merkel </PER> to push through her ideas . 

Support for the <MISC> FDP </MISC> slumped to 3 percent , according to a separate <ORG> Emnid </ORG> poll published on Sunday , while the conservatives were steady at 32 percent , giving them a combined 35 percent .

<MISC> Irish </MISC> house prices are getting close to a sustainable level where purchasers will be confident enough to re - enter the market following a property crash , <LOC> Ireland </LOC> ¡¯s central bank governor was quoted as saying on Sunday .

But What About ' Two and a Half Men ' ? 

* <PER> Merkel </PER> , <PER> Sarkozy </PER> to meet in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> late on Sunday 

* Will discuss differences on bank capital , <ORG> EFSF </ORG> bond buying 

* Meeting occurs as crisis risks spiralling into banking meltdown 

By <PER> Sarah Marsh </PER> and <PER> Yann Le Guernigou </PER> 

<LOC> BERLIN </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> will thrash out differences with <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> on Sunday over how to use the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s financial firepower to counter a sovereign debt crisis threatening the global economy . 

With the turmoil threatening to spiral into financial meltdown as the value of banks¡¯ sovereign bond holdings slide , <PER> Merkel </PER> and <PER> Sarkozy </PER> are likely to discuss in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> both how to manage <LOC> Greece </LOC> , prevent contagion and strengthen lenders . 

The implosion of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> lender <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , the first victim of the crisis , has added a sense of urgency to the talks . 

The prime ministers of <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Belgium </LOC> and the finance minister of <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> agreed a rescue plan for <ORG> Dexia </ORG> on Sunday ahead of the stricken Franco - <MISC> Belgian </MISC> bank . 

¡° <ORG> Dexia </ORG> will be among the topics that will be discussed but the main topic is <LOC> Greece </LOC> and the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone , as banks are only a consequence ¡± of the crisis , a source at the <ORG> French finance ministry </ORG> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> is due to arrive in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> late on Sunday afternoon and hold a meeting with <PER> Merkel </PER> followed by a working dinner . 

A news conference will take place at 1530 <MISC> GMT </MISC> . 

Talks are continuing over a vital aid tranche for <LOC> Greece </LOC> , which could run out of cash as soon as mid - November . 

<MISC> European </MISC> finance ministers are considering making banks take bigger losses on <MISC> Greek </MISC> debt ¡ª an issue that could be discussed at the <PER> Merkel </PER> - <PER> Sarkozy </PER> meeting . 

¡° It is possible that we assumed in July a level of debt reduction that was too low , ¡± <MISC> German </MISC> Finance Minister <PER> Wolfgang Schaeuble </PER> was cited as saying by a newspaper on Sunday . 

Separately , <ORG> European Commission </ORG> head <PER> Jose Manuel Barroso </PER> told <ORG> Bild </ORG> a <MISC> Greek </MISC> default would have unforeseeable consequences and may cause the crisis to spread . 

This is new territory for us and we are discussing solutions which have not really been tested before , ¡± he said . 

<LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> have so far been split over how to recapitalise <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s banks , which <LOC> Ireland </LOC> estimated on Saturday may need more than 100 billion euros ( $ 135 billion ) to withstand the sovereign debt crisis , while the <ORG> International Monetary Fund </ORG> ( <ORG> IMF </ORG> ) has said the banks need 200 billion in additional funds . 

<LOC> Paris </LOC> wants to tap the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s 440 billion <ORG> European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> ( <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) to recapitalise its own banks , while <LOC> Berlin </LOC> is insisting the fund should be used as a last resort . 

<LOC> Qatar </LOC> is being cited by some media as a potential saviour for <MISC> European </MISC> banks yet analysts believe tiny <MISC> Gulf Arab </MISC> state is an unlikely <PER> white knight </PER> , as <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s needs are too great . 

Top <MISC> French </MISC> banks <ORG> BNP Paribas </ORG> and <ORG> Societe Generale </ORG> 

denied a report on Sunday that they could seek to raise a combined 11 billion euros as part of a broader <MISC> European </MISC> bank recapitalisation plan . 

Another key dispute is how to use the EFSF to buy sovereign debt to prevent contagion of the crisis , particularly crucial if <LOC> Greece </LOC> fails to secure its next aid tranche . 

<LOC> France </LOC> does not want to set guidelines for the EFSF on the matter , whereas <LOC> Germany </LOC> wants to limit the sum used for each member state and set a time limit for bond purchasing . 

¡° Given that the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> is limited overall , it makes sense also to limit the purchases on the secondary market for each country , ¡± <PER> Michael Meister </PER> , deputy parliamentary leader of <PER> Merkel </PER> ¡¯s conservatives , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

There was a danger , otherwise , the funds could be quickly used up , he said . 

<LOC> Berlin </LOC> could be prepared to allow a more flexible use of the EFSF to prop up states and banks if <LOC> Paris </LOC> agrees to a broad haircut on <MISC> Greek </MISC> debt , a <MISC> German </MISC> paper wrote on Sunday . 

But a government source told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> : ¡° There is no such agreement ¡± . 

Furthermore , <PER> Merkel </PER> warned last Tuesday that the threat of contagion from a <MISC> euro </MISC> zone country rescheduling its debt would be huge , and it only made sense once it had achieved a primary surplus again . 

The two <MISC> euro </MISC> zone heavyweights have come under pressure worldwide to resolve <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s crisis which is roiling markets . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> President Barack Obama on Thursday urged <LOC> Europe </LOC> to ¡° act fast ¡± , calling the common currency bloc ¡¯s crisis the largest obstacle to the <ORG> United States¡¯ </ORG> own recovery . 

World Bank President <PER> Robert Zoellick </PER> told <ORG> Wirtschaftswoche </ORG> magazine there was a ¡° total lack ¡± of vision in <LOC> Europe </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> in particular needed to show more leadership . 

<PER> Merkel </PER> will visit <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> and <LOC> Mongolia </LOC> this coming week . 

Hurricane <PER> Jova </PER> , a category 1 storm off <LOC> Mexico </LOC> ¡¯s <LOC> Pacific coast </LOC> , strengthened on Sunday , with top winds reaching 90 miles per hour ( 150 kph ) . 

<PER> Jova </PER> was about 350 miles ( 560 km ) west - southwest of the port city of <LOC> Manzanillo </LOC> , the <LOC> Miami </LOC> - based <ORG> National Hurricane Center </ORG> said . 

No coastal watches or warnings were in effect but the center warned that a hurricane watch would likely be required for parts of southwest <LOC> Mexico </LOC> later on Sunday . 

<PER> Jova </PER> could become a major hurricane by Monday night or Tuesday , the center said . 

It is expected to reach land early next week . 

<LOC> Mexico </LOC> has no oil installations in the <LOC> Pacific </LOC> but <PER> Jova </PER> is headed to a part of the coast that is popular with tourists . 

All <LOC> Mexico </LOC> ¡¯s major ports were open .

<ORG> YAOUNDE </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Voters in <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> faced delays and organizational snags in an election on Sunday where President <PER> Paul Biya </PER> is expected to extend his 29-year rule over the <MISC> central African </MISC> state against a fragmented opposition . 

The one - round vote comes just weeks after a smooth handover of power in <LOC> Zambia </LOC> showed that <LOC> Africa </LOC> can deliver peaceful political change through the ballot box . 

But with <PER> Biya </PER> , 78 , seen keeping his place among the clutch of <MISC> African </MISC> leaders in power for decades , the main question in the oil - producing nation is whether the election will pass smoothly after rivals alleged the vote is skewed against them . 

Election observers said early voting had begun peacefully but cited delays at some polling stations and irregularities , such as some voters being allowed to jump the queue . 

¡° We ¡¯re a bit concerned , there seems to be separate treatment for VIP voters , ¡± <ORG> Commonwealth </ORG> observer mission leader <PER> Frederick Mitchell </PER> , the Bahamas¡¯ ex - foreign minister , said by telephone . 

<PER> Samuel Enyegue </PER> , a resident of the capital <LOC> Yaounde </LOC> , was one of a number of voters interviewed by <ORG> Reuters </ORG> who said he had been unable to cast his vote . 

This is pure rubbish , ¡± said <PER> Enyegue </PER> outside a polling station in the Biyem - <PER> Assi </PER> district . 

I can not understand why I registered but my name is not on the ( voters¡¯ ) list . ¡± 

<PER> Biya </PER> ¡¯s main rival <PER> John Fru Ndi </PER> of the <ORG> Social Democratic Front </ORG> ( <ORG> SDF </ORG> ) said a surplus of voting slips meant some had voted twice in certain parts of the country and said election body Elecam would be blamed for the ¡° disorder and confusion . 

Casting his vote in <LOC> Yaounde </LOC> , <PER> Biya </PER> asked for patience . 

¡° It ( Elecam ) is a young organization ... 

I ¡¯m just asking that there should be indulgence in any eventual imperfection . 

There was no intention to fraud , ¡± he said . 

Aside from its oil , <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> is the region ¡¯s main maritime entry point and breadbasket , supplying <LOC> Chad </LOC> , <LOC> Central African Republic </LOC> , <LOC> Congo Republic </LOC> and <LOC> Gabon </LOC> . 

It hosts the <LOC> Chad </LOC> - <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> pipeline and shelters refugees from the region ¡¯s conflicts . 

<PER> Biya </PER> faces 22 candidates including <ORG> Fru Ndi </ORG> , and <PER> Adamou Ndam Njoya </PER> of the <ORG> Cameroon Democratic Union </ORG> ( <ORG> UDC </ORG> ) . 

In the last election in 2004 , <PER> Biya </PER> scored just over 70 percent , while his closest rival , <PER> Fru Ndi </PER> , took 17 percent . 

In 2008 a move by <PER> Biya </PER> to scrap term limits , and anger over food prices , led to street protests in which more than 100 people died , but for most of the past three decades there has seen relative stability in a turbulent region . 

However , one issue which has not gone away is a separatist movement in the south and last week security forces detained more than 200 people after they held a banned rally calling for the right to secede . 

<PER> Biya </PER> ¡¯s goal is to set <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> on the path to being an emerging nation such as <LOC> Mexico </LOC> and <LOC> Malaysia </LOC> by 2035 . 

Yet <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> ¡¯s media and opposition have criticized <PER> Biya </PER> for lax governance , allowing corruption , red tape and nepotism to fester . 

Average income per head stands at an annual $ 2,000 ¡ª higher than most of the region ¡ª but the IMF has described its forecast 3.8 percent growth this year as below potential . 

Some observers speculate that <PER> Biya </PER> , if reelected , will use his new term to arrange a handover of power to an anointed successor . 

But his domination of the local political scene means there is currently no obvious candidate for that . 

Polling is scheduled to end at 6.00 p.m. ( 1700 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) but a ban on the announcement of preliminary results mean it could take days for the final tally to be published .

<LOC> BEIJING </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <PER> Alberto Contador </PER> will be enough of a weapon against the might of the <ORG> new RadioShack </ORG> - <ORG> Nissan </ORG> cycling team next year , the <MISC> Spaniard </MISC> ¡¯s <ORG> Saxo Bank </ORG> team manager <PER> Bjarne Riis </PER> said on Sunday . 

<MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Johan Bruyneel </PER> , who guided <PER> Lance Armstrong </PER> to his record seven <MISC> Tour de France titles </MISC> , will be at the helm of <ORG> RadioShack </ORG> - <ORG> Nissan </ORG> , the result of the merger between <ORG> RadioShack </ORG> and <ORG> Leopard </ORG> - Trek . 

Twice Tour runner - up <PER> Andy Schleck </PER> is set to be the leader of an outfit also likely to feature <PER> Andreas Kloeden </PER> and time - trial and one - day race specialist <PER> Fabian Cancellara </PER> . 

Maybe <PER> Johan Bruyneel </PER> will be leading the best team in the world ¡ª and that ¡¯s not even sure , ¡± <PER> Dane Riis </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> at the Tour of <LOC> Beijing </LOC> , which ended on Sunday . 

, I will always have the best rider in the world and that ¡¯s a fact . 

<PER> Contador </PER> , however , is awaiting a Court of Arbitration for Sport ( <ORG> CAS </ORG> ) ruling next month over a failed dope test in the 2010 <LOC> Tour de France </LOC> . 

The <MISC> Spaniard </MISC> , one of only five men with wins in all three grands Tours ( Giro , Tour , Vuelta ) , could face a two - year ban if the <ORG> CAS </ORG> , following an appeal by the <ORG> International Cycling Union </ORG> ( <ORG> UCI </ORG> ) and the World Anti - <ORG> Doping Agency </ORG> ( <ORG> WADA </ORG> ) , overturn the <MISC> Spanish </MISC> federation ¡¯s decision to clear <PER> Contador </PER> . 

<PER> Contador </PER> , who suffered his first defeat in a <MISC> grand Tour </MISC> since 2007 in this year ¡¯s Tour de <LOC> France </LOC> , would , at least , be stripped of his 2010 Tour title if found guilty . 

¡° I ca n¡¯t wait for this to be over , ¡± <PER> Riis </PER> said . 

I am optimistic although there is still the fear that CAS could rule against him . 

I am waiting but it is long , too long . 

It ¡¯s been dragging on for over a year . ¡± 

<PER> Contador </PER> denied any wrongdoing , saying his failed test came because he ate contaminated meat .

Nearly 200 factories , including one run by <MISC> Japanese </MISC> car maker <ORG> Honda Motor Co Ltd </ORG> , closed in the central <MISC> Thai </MISC> province of <LOC> Ayutthaya </LOC> because of flooding , which could threaten <LOC> Bangkok </LOC> this week , officials said on Sunday . 

About 261 people have died since late July in flood - related incidents , the <ORG> Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation </ORG> said . 

Some 2.3 million people have been affected in the worst flooding to hit parts of <LOC> Thailand </LOC> in 50 years , mainly in the center , north and northeast . 

The Rojana estate in <LOC> Ayutthaya </LOC> province , run by <ORG> Rojana Industrial Park Pcl </ORG> , was flooded after a wall of sandbags failed to hold back water overnight . 

¡° All 198 factories at Rojana have to be closed because the water is about 5.1 meters high , ¡± Industry Minister <PER> Wannarat Channukul </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

A <ORG> Honda </ORG> spokeswoman said it had moved about 3,000 assembled cars from the estate to other areas . 

<ORG> Hana Microelectronics Pcl </ORG> has also had to close its plant in <LOC> Ayutthaya </LOC> . 

On Thursday the Center for Economic and Business Forecasting , part of the University of the <ORG> Thai Chamber of Commerce </ORG> , cut its forecast for gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth this year to 3.6 percent from 4.4 percent because of the floods . 

It put the impact of the flooding at between 1.0 and 1.3 percentage points of GDP and said its new growth forecast would have been lower but for recent strength in exports . 

The <ORG> commerce ministry </ORG> said on Friday it had slashed its forecast for the main rice crop , which farmers are just starting to bring in , to 21 million tones from 25 million because of the flooding . 

<LOC> Thailand </LOC> is the world ¡¯s biggest rice exporter . 

The crop damage will add to the pressure on export prices , already being forced up by the high buying price set under a government intervention scheme aimed at helping poor farmers . 

<LOC> Bangkok </LOC> Governor <PER> Sukhumbhand Paribatra </PER> said in a statement the authorities were preparing an evacuation plan to move people from affected areas if floods hit the capital , much of which is just two meters above sea level . 

Some <LOC> riverside </LOC> areas have already suffered minor flooding but the level of the <LOC> Chao Phraya </LOC> River could rise sharply from October 15 - 18 when a large amount of water will reach the area from the north , where dams are close to overflowing , at a time of high sea tides . 

The government was trying to accelerate the drainage of water from the <LOC> Chao Phraya </LOC> into the sea before the high tide . 

Other Southeast <MISC> Asian </MISC> countries have suffered serious flooding in recent weeks because of heavy monsoon rains combined with tropical storms . 

The death toll from two strong typhoons that cut across the north of the <LOC> Philippines¡¯ </LOC> main island and left behind widespread flooding had risen to 101 as of Sunday , the <ORG> national disaster agency </ORG> said . 

At least 167 people had died in <LOC> Cambodia </LOC> by late last week and 15 in <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> .

* <LOC> Beijing </LOC> issues wealth management rules , effective Jan 1 

* Tells banks not to use wealth products to draw deposits 

<LOC> BEIJING </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> China </LOC> has signed off a set of rules for its small but booming wealth management sector to temper rapid growth and prevent banks from exploiting loopholes to beat regulation . 

More than just an area of growth , <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s wealth industry has been used by banks to attract deposits and skirt lending restrictions , much to the chagrin of <LOC> Beijing </LOC> which wants to control lending to manage inflation . 

The new rules would , among other things , prohibit banks from using wealth products to attract deposits or from luring customers into buying products that do not conform with their risk appetites . 

In a 21-page , 80-clause document released by the <ORG> China Banking Regulatory Commission </ORG> on Sunday , <LOC> Beijing </LOC> stressed that banks must toe the line or be punished . 

The rules are effective from January 1 , 2012 . 

In recent years , the wealth management business in commercial banks has grown rapidly , ¡± the regulator said , noting that banks have grown more creative in the way they design , sell and manage wealth products . 

But at the same time , the growth has exposed problems and weaknesses , ¡± it said . 

There have even been instances of misguided or misleading sales , harming consumers¡¯ interests and banks¡¯ reputations . 

In <LOC> China </LOC> , <LOC> Beijing </LOC> tells banks how much to lend and at what price by setting loan quotas and limits on deposit and lending rates . 

This has fed stiff competition between banks when it comes to courting savers , leading them to sell wealth products with yields well above benchmark deposit rates to attract deposits and support loan growth . 

<LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s wealth industry has grown at an average rate of 45 percent in the past three years , <PER> Liu Mingkang </PER> , head of the <ORG> bank regulator </ORG> , said earlier this year . 

He said the sector managed 1.7 trillion yuan ( $ 266 billion ) as of the end of 2010 . 

Below are some of rules outlined by the regulator : 

¡ª Banks can not use wealth products to attract deposits or bundle products in other promotions 

¡ª Banks can not lure deposits by raising interest rates in ¡° disguised ¡± forms 

¡ª Promotions can not be aired on television ; they must be fair and open , and explain potential risks in simple language to protect interests of customers who can not be misled 

¡ª Promotions should have this phrase in a prominent spot : Wealth management is not a form of savings ; products have risks ; invest carefully . 

¡ª Banks can not trick customers into buying products that do not conform with their risk appetites 

¡ª Sales tactics such as price discounts and free gifts are not allowed 

¡ª Banks can not promise investment returns or vow to undertake losses when selling products 

¡ª Customers must be informed of any changes in investment strategies that may swing returns 

¡ª Clients have the right to redeem investments if they do not accept proposed investment changes 

¡ª Sales staff should be judged by how well they sell and the number of customer complaints they get 

¡ª Banks must tell <LOC> Beijing </LOC> who their target clients are ; where their wealth businesses are and they are run

<LOC> JERUSALEM </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <ORG> East Mediterranean Gas </ORG> ( EMG ) has filed a request for international arbitration in the wake of a series of gas disruptions from <LOC> Egypt </LOC> , an EMG stakeholder said on Sunday . 

Ampal - <ORG> American Israel Corp </ORG> , which owns 12.5 percent of <ORG> East Mediterranean Gas </ORG> ( EMG ) , said EMG seeks to begin arbitration hearings against <ORG> Egyptian General Petroleum Corp </ORG> and <ORG> Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co </ORG> ( <ORG> EGAS </ORG> ) through the <ORG> International Chamber of Commerce </ORG> . 

EMG is seeking compensation from <LOC> Egypt </LOC> for damages resulting from contractual breaches , <PER> Ampal </PER> said in a statement to the <ORG> Tel Aviv Stock Exchange </ORG> . 

¡° Ampal , as well as other international shareholders , are determined to pursue every available avenue to secure the smooth operation of EMG , ¡± said <PER> Yosef Maiman </PER> , chairman , president and chief executive of Ampal . 

In July , an EMG board member told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> that shareholders in the company were seeking $ 8 billion in damages to EMG and its clients from contract violations in gas supplies . 

¡° EMG is pursuing all legal options whether it ¡¯s by shareholders or by the company , 

¡± a source close to EMG told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> relies on <LOC> Egypt </LOC> for more than 40 percent of gas needs to <LOC> Israel </LOC> ¡¯s electric utility but supplies have been cut off a number of times this year due to attacks on the pipeline ¡ª run by <PER> EGAS </PER> ¡ª that also supplies gas to <LOC> Jordan </LOC> . 

The attacks are believed to be from militants opposed to selling <MISC> Egyptian </MISC> gas to <LOC> Israel </LOC> . 

EMG is also 12.5 percent owned by <ORG> Merhav </ORG> which is held by <PER> Maiman </PER> while other stakeholders in EMG include <MISC> Egyptian </MISC> businessman <PER> Hussain Salem </PER> , <LOC> Egypt </LOC> Natural <ORG> Gas Co </ORG> , <LOC> Thailand </LOC> ¡¯s 

<ORG> PTT </ORG> 

and <LOC> U.S. </LOC> businessman <PER> Sam Zell </PER> . 

¡° Ampal , as well as other international investors , have invested a substantial amount of money in EMG through direct investments and in EMG ¡¯s shares , ¡± <PER> Maiman </PER> said . 

<LOC> Egypt </LOC> ¡¯s new government has also been trying to amend its contracts with <LOC> Israel </LOC> and <LOC> Jordan </LOC> following complaints that prices fixed during former President <PER> Hosni Mubarak </PER> ¡¯s rule were below market rates . 

We hope that the government of <LOC> Egypt </LOC> and the <MISC> Egyptian </MISC> state - controlled gas supplier elect to honor the obligations under the gas sale and purchase agreement , ¡± <PER> Maiman </PER> said . 

However , we will continue to take all necessary actions to protect our investments . 

The gas disruptions have already caused financial harm to state - owned <ORG> Israel Electric Corp </ORG> , which has had to switch to more expensive fuel to generate electricity . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Commodities trading giant <ORG> Glencore </ORG> 

could come to the aid of <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> ¡¯s Bakrie family over the financing of a loan backed by a stake in <LOC> London </LOC> - listed <ORG> Bumi </ORG> 

, the Sunday <ORG> Telegraph </ORG> reported . 

A holding company for the Bakries , one of <LOC> Indonesia </LOC> ¡¯s most politically connected families , said last week it was looking to restructure or repay a $ 597 million loan , part of $ 1.35 billion leant by <ORG> Credit Suisse </ORG> in March . 

Bankers with knowledge of the matter said <ORG> Bakrie Group </ORG> 

would not let go its control over <ORG> Bumi </ORG> , an <MISC> Indonesian </MISC> mining company created by <PER> Nat Rothschild </PER> in which it holds a 54.6 percent stake , despite the loan issue . 

The Sunday <ORG> Telegraph </ORG> said , without citing sources , that <ORG> Glencore </ORG> was looking at providing some sort of ¡° quasi - debt facility ¡± to support the family but was understood not to be interested in any equity . 

Analysts at <ORG> Liberum </ORG> said last week that although they had no detailed knowledge of the loan agreement , <ORG> Glencore </ORG> would be an obvious buyer of any Bakrie shares , given that it signed a share swop agreement with the Bakries last year over 4.8 percent of the company and it marketed <ORG> Bumi </ORG> ¡¯s coal . 

Both <ORG> Glencore </ORG> and <ORG> Bumi </ORG> declined to comment on the report . 

* Civic Platform led Law and Justice in opinion polls 

* Civic Platform says it guarantees stability , reform 

* Law and Justice victory could test <LOC> Russia </LOC> , <LOC> Germany </LOC> ties 

By <PER> Gabriela Baczynska </PER> and <PER> Rob Strybel </PER> 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> voted in a parliamentary election on Sunday that could give Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> ¡¯s centre - right Civic Platform four more years in power to pursue gradual economic reforms and preserve political stability . 

Civic Platform , which guided <LOC> Poland </LOC> through the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis and favours closer ties with the rest of the <ORG> European Union </ORG> , would be the first party to hold on to power in an election in <LOC> Poland </LOC> since Communism collapsed in 1989 . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> , 54 , has promised to continue cautious economic reforms if he retains power , and has made clear he will press on with efforts to ensure stable relations with <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s large and powerful neighbours , <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> Russia </LOC> . 

But some opinion polls before the election showed former premier <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s conservative - nationalist Law and Justice party catching up in second place , and pollsters said it could challenge Civic Platform if the voter turnout is low . 

The <ORG> election commission </ORG> said 23 percent of voters had cast ballots by 2.00 p.m. ( 1200 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) and commentators said this could point to a low turnout . 

<PER> Kaczynski </PER> rails against <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> Russia </LOC> and his return to power after four years in opposition could threaten ties with <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s largest neighbours , and political stability , but he would have difficulty building a stable coalition . 

<ORG> ¡° Democracy </ORG> is strong through participation . 

With a 20 - 30 percent turnout , democracy wilts before our very eyes . 

I hope the turnout will be at least middling and not dramatically lower than normal , ¡± former president <PER> Aleksander Kwasniewski </PER> said . 

No party is expected to win an outright majority and another four years of coalition government are likely in the country of more than 38 million people after Civic Platform ¡¯s four - year alliance with the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> . 

President <PER> Bronislaw Komorowski </PER> , who hails from <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s party , made clear he expected coalition talks to start quickly after the election and added : 

I will begin them with the leader of the <ORG> victorious party </ORG> . 

<PER> Tusk portrays </PER> himself as a guardian of stability . 

A mild - mannered pragmatist with a common touch , he has eschewed radical economic reforms , avoided talk of austerity despite a large budget deficit and promised to continue cautious reforms . 

<ORG> ¡° PO </ORG> ( Civic Platform ) should continue to govern because they have done a great deal . 

Just look at the roads , ¡± said <PER> Maria Mlodzikowska </PER> , an 80-year - old retired physical education teacher , after voting in <LOC> Warsaw </LOC> . 

Law and Justice has promised more state involvement in the economy , including a bank tax and higher taxes for the rich , and vowed to wind down large - scale privatisation . 

The Law and Justice - led coalition collapsed in acrimony in 2007 . 

<PER> Jan Mazur </PER> , a 74-year - old retired printer , said he had voted for Law and Justice for the sake of his grandchildren . 

¡° I do n¡¯t want them to grow up in a country which owns nothing because the PO has sold everything off under the pretext of what they call privatisation , ¡± he said . 

Ratings agencies say they could downgrade <LOC> Poland </LOC> if it does not swiftly act to reduce the budget deficit , expected to reach 5.6 percent of gross domestic product this year , and the public debt , expected to reach 53.8 percent of GDP this year . 

Economists doubt Law and Justice would be able to meet the challenge . 

The current coalition , however , has failed to deliver on promises of far - reaching liberal market reforms . 

The <ORG> EU </ORG> ¡¯s largest former communist economy has lost some of its lustre since 2007 , but <LOC> Poland </LOC> was the only <ORG> EU </ORG> state to maintain positive growth through the turmoil of 2008 - 2009 and growth is forecast to be about 4 percent this year .

The party , led by Civic Platform defector <PER> Janusz Palikot </PER> , supports gay rights , abortion and legalisation of soft drugs . 

¡° I support Palikot ... at least he ¡¯ll be a breath of fresh air in the stiflingly stodgy Sejm , ¡± said <PER> Krystyna Celinska </PER> , a 28-year - old graphic artist . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> favours deeper <ORG> EU </ORG> integration for the <ORG> NATO </ORG> member state and has built up relations with <LOC> Moscow </LOC> and <LOC> Berlin </LOC> .

* Oil workers on strike , demand justice , change and training 

* <ORG> Conoco </ORG> , Marathon and <ORG> Hess </ORG> are joint - owners of troubled <ORG> Waha </ORG> Oil 

* Workers say 380,000 bpd complex targeted by <ORG> Nato </ORG> , restart 4 - 6mths 

<LOC> TRIPOLI </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Workers protesting at the headquarters of <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s National Oil Company on Sunday said they would strike until managers were replaced and possibly tried for fighting alongside Gaddafi . 

Most of the crowd worked for Waha Oil , a joint venture with <MISC> American </MISC> firms <ORG> ConocoPhillips </ORG> , Marathon and <ORG> Amerada Hess </ORG> . 

Documents proving managers had used the Waha Oil complex as a base for <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> fighters had been presented to the NOC chairman that morning , protesters said . 

The oil fields had been targeted by <ORG> NATO </ORG> because they were used to feed , shelter and equip loyalist fighters , according to the workers , who said it could take four to six months to restart flows . 

¡° There is a lot of damage at the fields ... especially at <LOC> Gialo </LOC> and <LOC> Waha </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Ahmed Zahmun </PER> , a Waha Oil protester . 

In an interview last week , the <ORG> NOC ¡¯s </ORG> chairman told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> that <ORG> NATO </ORG> airstrikes on <MISC> Libyan </MISC> oil fields had been executed with ¡° surgical precision ¡± . 

A source at <ORG> NOC </ORG> confirmed <PER> Nouri Berouin </PER> , the chairman , had met Waha Oil workers on Sunday , but added requests to remove directors had not been heeded . 

Other North <MISC> American </MISC> firms in <LOC> Libya </LOC> are facing contrasting fortunes , with <ORG> Occidental </ORG> and <ORG> Suncor </ORG> both restarting production at fields in the eastern part of the <LOC> Sirte basin </LOC> this week . 

<MISC> European </MISC> companies , including <MISC> German </MISC> , <MISC> Italian </MISC> and <MISC> French </MISC> oil firms , have also succeeded in pumping oil for the first time since war broke out , but they have met with mixed fates as well . 

Last week an operations manager at <ORG> Eni </ORG> ¡¯s 

headquarters in <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> the <MISC> Italian </MISC> oil and gas company ¡¯s largest oilfield , Elephant , lay in ruins and would not restart until 2012 . 

<ORG> Eni </ORG> ¡¯s CEO later said the company did not know of any damage to the field . 

So far , oil has yet to flow from the West and parts of <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s oil - rich basin remain too dangerous to inspect . 

Waha Oil pumped just under 400,000 barrels of oil per day ( bpd ) before the war , but is now producing no crude and field workers say they will not return until managers were replaced . 

Protesters said <MISC> Libyans </MISC> had been denied the opportunity to get a good job throughout Gaddafi ¡¯s rule and wanted a better future . 

¡° After more than 40 years , we are still relying on foreign workers . 

<MISC> Libyans </MISC> have no chance to get a good position . 

There is no future strategy , ¡± said <PER> Ahmed Zahmoul </PER> . 

Sunday ¡¯s protest followed a similar demonstration last week at <LOC> Waha </LOC> Oil ¡¯s headquarters . 

Engineers there reported damage was severe in parts of the complex , while some oil fields were still unsafe to visit . 

<ORG> Waha </ORG> Oil workers were joined by employees at the <ORG> Libyan Petroleum Institute </ORG> , who also said their managers had actively supported <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> ¡¯s army . 

The army came there for rifles and machine guns , ¡± said <PER> Ibrahim Twebti </PER> , an employee at the institute . 

Punishment was up to the <MISC> Libyan </MISC> court charged with processing Gaddafi loyalists , protesters said , but whatever the result , managers were unqualified for their jobs and should not be allowed to stay on . 

We want to change that , ¡± said <PER> Hatem Wafa </PER> , a geophysicist at the protest . 

<LOC> Egypt </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Orascom Telecom </ORG> 

appointed <PER> Khalid Ellaicy </PER> as the firm <ORG> ¡¯s new chief financial officer </ORG> ( CFO ) to start on Oct. 17 , the firm said in a statement on Sunday . 

<ORG> Ellaicy </ORG> replaces <PER> Aldo Mareuse </PER> who joined <ORG> Orascom </ORG> as the group ¡¯s CFO in 2002 . 

The new CFO has over 26 years of experience in the finance sector and was partner in KPMG <LOC> Egypt </LOC> . 

He assisted in <ORG> Orascom </ORG> ¡¯s initial public offering ( IPO ) and later worked with <LOC> Mobinil </LOC> 

as the firm ¡¯s CFO , the company said .

Hopes may be disappointed for an influx of money from <LOC> Qatar </LOC> and other rich <LOC> Gulf states </LOC> into battered <MISC> European </MISC> banks , since <LOC> Gulf </LOC> investors are likely to see many of the banks as too risky and out of line with their investment strategies . 

As <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s banking system has weakened over the last several months , financial markets have been abuzz with rumors and media reports about possible investments from the <LOC> Gulf </LOC> ¡ª particularly from cash - rich <LOC> Qatar </LOC> , which has been on an international acquisitions spree . 

Analysts and bankers said it was possible that <LOC> Qatar </LOC> would make relatively small investments , perhaps of several hundred million euros , in <MISC> European </MISC> financial firms . 

Some <MISC> European </MISC> media reports last week said <LOC> Qatar </LOC> was part of an international consortium discussing a purchase of <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> arm , valued at some 900 million euros ( $ 1.2 billion ) . 

But analysts said <LOC> Qatar </LOC> and other <LOC> Gulf states </LOC> were unlikely to invest aggressively enough to make much difference to big <MISC> European </MISC> financial institutions . 

¡° Not even <LOC> Qatar </LOC> ¡¯s pockets are deep enough to really throw meaningful capital at the <MISC> European </MISC> financial system . 

They could participate in some of the capital raising that banks are doing , but ultimately , public multilateral support is needed , ¡± said <PER> Rachel Ziemba </PER> , director at <ORG> Roubini </ORG> Global Economics in <LOC> London </LOC> . 

¡° Investors like <LOC> Qatar </LOC> will be seriously looking to see whether the macroeconomic framework and policy response will give them a good return on their investment . 

<LOC> Qatar </LOC> was slow to invest in the first round of bank recaps in 2008 to 2009 , and actually extracted some of the stronger returns . 

A Doha - based financial industry executive said he believed <LOC> Qatar </LOC> was probably ¡° talking with every bank in <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

But it remains to be seen whether the negotiations will lead to anything concrete . 

Official data are not available but <ORG> Qatar ¡¯s sovereign wealth fund </ORG> , the <ORG> Qatar Investment Authority </ORG> ( <ORG> QIA </ORG> ) , is estimated to have assets worth around $ 70 billion , of which an unknown proportion is currently uninvested and available for new deals . 

But analysts said the <ORG> Alpha Bank </ORG> merger did not indicate <LOC> Qatar </LOC> was willing to take on financial sector risk on a large scale ¡ª especially at a time when , like other <LOC> Gulf states </LOC> , it is seeking to ensure political stability with a sharp boost in government spending . 

<LOC> Qatar </LOC> has roughly doubled some public sector salaries and pensions this year . 

¡° I think the Qataris would be looking for value , and <MISC> European </MISC> banks will have to get cheaper and more desperate before <LOC> Qatar </LOC> would jump in , ¡± one Doha - based analyst said . 

¡° It would not be on the scale that would have a massive impact on the crisis . 

<LOC> Qatar </LOC> will hardly be a white knight , but rather take a more opportunistic approach . 

Other <LOC> Gulf states </LOC> may be even more cautious , analysts said . 

The <ORG> Abu Dhabi Investment Authority </ORG> has some $ 600 billion of assets , but <LOC> Abu Dhabi </LOC> was required to bail out <LOC> Dubai </LOC> during a property market crash two years ago and if the global economy worsens , it may yet need to provide more support . 

<LOC> Saudi Arabia </LOC> also has a huge financial war chest , but its government embarked this year on a $ 130 billion spending program on housing and other projects . 

With global oil prices approaching levels at which its budget surplus could disappear , it may not want to undertake risky new investments abroad . 

Another issue for <LOC> Qatar </LOC> and other <LOC> Gulf states </LOC> is whether <MISC> European </MISC> financial investments would serve their long - term , strategic aims . 

Increasingly , the <LOC> Gulf </LOC> is looking to <LOC> Asia </LOC> for growth and investment , while investing in energy and technology projects might make more sense than buying into an apparent sunset industry such as Western banking . 

¡° I would expect <LOC> Qatar </LOC> and other <MISC> Gulf SWFs </MISC> ( sovereign wealth funds ) to continue to look for solid investments that are available cheaply , but they are not altruistic per se , ¡± <PER> Ziemba </PER> said . 

¡° They are looking to make financial returns and invest in companies that help extend their supply chain , help <LOC> Qatar </LOC> ... enter new supply chains and gain access to key technology transfer through partnerships to help build up human capital . 

Moreover , it remains to be seen how comfortable <MISC> European </MISC> governments will be with foreign sovereign wealth funds taking on a significant share in banking and corporations . 

The financial market speculation about <LOC> Qatar </LOC> ¡¯s intentions resembles that over <LOC> China </LOC> . 

Rumors have abounded this year that <LOC> Beijing </LOC> will deploy more of its $ 3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to buy the government debt of <LOC> Greece </LOC> and other weak <MISC> European </MISC> countries . 

But so far , <MISC> Chinese </MISC> buying has not prevented a collapse of the bond prices of indebted <MISC> European </MISC> states . 

There is no evidence that <LOC> China </LOC> is buying more <MISC> euro </MISC> zone bonds than the weighting of the <MISC> euro </MISC> in its reserves would indicate , and many of the bonds it does hold are believed to be <MISC> German </MISC> and other top - quality credits , not the debt of weak countries . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> crop supply - demand data and solid rains forecast for the parched southern <LOC> Plains breadbasket </LOC> will compete in agricultural futures markets with the <MISC> European </MISC> debt crisis to see if fundamentals or risk - off sentiment will prevail this week . 

Lower on the radar will be a <ORG> Senate </ORG> vote on a bill aimed at pressing <LOC> China </LOC> into raising the value of its currency , which some grains analysts fear could draw fire from the top buyer of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> soybeans and importer of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> corn . 

Traders will also watch the corn and soybean harvest , with clear skies paving the way for the best week so far in the <LOC> Midwest </LOC> grain belt . 

<LOC> Chicago </LOC> Board of Trade grain futures have been taking price direction the last few weeks largely from macroeconomic factors centered on <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s debt crisis and the gyrating dollar , even as the world ¡¯s biggest corn and soy harvest progressed , with prices dropping to multi - month lows . 

CBOT wheat futures and soybean futures fell for the fifth straight week last week , while corn was able to snap a five - week losing streak , but just barely . 

Despite the big slump in prices ¡ª corn is down 25 percent from its all - time high near $ 8 per bushels set in June and wheat on the cusp of slipping below $ 6 per bushel ¡ª analysts are not convinced the market is near a bottom . 

¡° I ¡¯m not banking on a rebound , ¡± said grains analyst <PER> Karl Setzer </PER> of <ORG> MaxYield Cooperative </ORG> in <LOC> West Bend </LOC> , <LOC> Iowa </LOC> . 

It ¡¯s a hard time for commodities to rally . 

The underlying mind - set of the market is for speculators to not buy the breaks and sell during rallies , ¡± he added . 

<LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> , the top two economies in <LOC> Europe </LOC> , were split ahead of a summit on Sunday over how to recapitalize shaky <MISC> European </MISC> banks and counter a sovereign debt crisis that threatens to stall the global economic recovery . 

Rating agency Fitch cut <LOC> Italy </LOC> ¡¯s sovereign debt rating by one notch and <LOC> Spain </LOC> ¡¯s by two , citing a worsening of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis and a risk of fiscal slippage . 

Fears that <LOC> Greece </LOC> could default on its debt escalated , chilling investments in risky assets such as commodities . 

The <ORG> EU </ORG> has put on another Band - Aid . 

Band - Aids can slow the bleeding but not stop it , ¡± <PER> Setzer </PER> said . 

Fears of a <MISC> Greek </MISC> default triggering a contagion across <LOC> Europe </LOC> and slowing global growth has led money managers to cut bullish bets in corn and soy for a fifth straight week . 

But they still hold a sizable net long position in CBOT corn of 115,255 contracts , and 27,448 contracts in soybeans , and analysts fear further liquidation . 

The <ORG> U.S. Department of Agriculture ¡¯s supply </ORG> - demand report on Wednesday could offer price direction as it updates <LOC> U.S. </LOC> corn and soybeans production and ending stocks data . 

The report follows one on quarterly grain stocks last week that took traders by surprise as corn stocks came in 17 percent above an average trade estimate . 

¡° Traders were shell - shocked by the quarterly stocks numbers , ¡± said grains analyst <PER> Mike Zuzolo </PER> of <ORG> Global Commodity Analytics </ORG> in <LOC> Lafayette </LOC> , <LOC> Indiana </LOC> . 

<PER> Zuzolo </PER> said he was expecting the <ORG> USDA </ORG> to slightly increase its estimate of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> corn yield , adding that a recent drop in prices have helped to lift export demand for soybeans . 

A <ORG> Reuters </ORG> Poll showed analysts on average expected the <ORG> USDA </ORG> to marginally raise corn yield to 148.8 bushels per acre from 148.1 bushels in September . 

They were expecting the soy yield to be unchanged at 41.8 bushels per acre . 

<PER> Zuzolo </PER> also said there was some concern over the <ORG> Senate </ORG> ¡¯s bill on the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> currency . 

<LOC> China </LOC> is buying a lot more corn and pork 

and they are the No 1 buyer of soybeans , ¡± he said .

Air passengers in <LOC> Germany </LOC> may face delays this week due to separate actions by ground handling staff and possibly by air traffic controllers . 

At 10 <MISC> German </MISC> airports , including major hubs <LOC> Frankfurt </LOC> and <LOC> Munich </LOC> , several thousand ground handling staff will hold meetings on Monday afternoon to discuss <ORG> European Commission </ORG> plans to boost competition among ground handling services at airports . 

In <LOC> Frankfurt </LOC> alone , around 1,200 staff , or about 80 percent of ground handlers , will take part in the meetings , a regional spokesman for <ORG> service trade union Verdi </ORG> said on Sunday . 

<LOC> Germany </LOC> ¡¯s largest airline , <ORG> Lufthansa </ORG> said disruption of services , such as flight delays , was likely . 

¡° We are actively preparing for it and hope to limit the effect on passengers as much as possible , ¡± a <ORG> Lufthansa </ORG> spokeswoman said . 

<PER> Verdi </PER> called the meetings to inform ground handlers about 

<ORG> EU </ORG> commissioner <PER> Siim Kallas¡¯ </PER> plan to force airports to allow at least three ground handling providers to operate on their premises instead of the current two . 

In addition , air traffic controllers may take action this week after their union on Friday rejected a mediator ¡¯s proposal in a wage dispute . 

The union ¡¯s wage bargaining committee is due to meet on Monday to discuss the further course of action . 

The union has pledged to give 24 hours¡¯ notice of any work stoppage . 

The union ¡¯s chief negotiator , <PER> Dirk Vogelsang </PER> , on Sunday said that if the union did opt to strike , the strike would certainly come this week . 

Air traffic controllers would stick to their plans for six - hour work stoppages if it does come to a strike , <PER> Vogelsang </PER> said . 

Two strikes planned by the air traffic controllers in August , which besides <ORG> Lufthansa </ORG> could also have affected Air <LOC> Berlin </LOC> , <PER> Thomas Cook </PER> ¡¯s airline <ORG> Condor </ORG> and <ORG> TUI </ORG> , were averted at the last minute . 

<LOC> POPRAD </LOC> , <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> , Oct. 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - The <ORG> Volkswagen </ORG> , <ORG> Peugeot </ORG> and <ORG> Kia </ORG> car plants along the main highway illustrate <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> ¡¯s transformation from ex - communist backwater to <MISC> euro </MISC> zone success , the world ¡¯s top auto maker per capita . 

They also explain its dilemma over <LOC> Greece </LOC> . 

No strangers to privations and harsh economic reform , <MISC> Slovaks </MISC> are divided over whether their government should agree to increasing the powers of the fund set up to help <LOC> Greece </LOC> and other <MISC> euro </MISC> zone countries that have lived beyond their means . 

So laborious is <ORG> EU </ORG> decision - making , that one dissenting voice among the 17 countries that use the <MISC> euro </MISC> could wreck the latest plan . 

It ¡¯s a debate the rest of the world is following with concern . 

Should <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> , the single currency ¡¯s second poorest member , pay for countries like <LOC> Greece </LOC> , which borrowed too much , fudged data and spurned the thorough economic reforms that <MISC> Slovaks </MISC> endured to join the <MISC> euro </MISC> in 2009 ? 

The <MISC> Greeks </MISC> have big pensions and retire early . 

I ¡¯ll have to work until I ¡¯m 65 to help pay off the loans that our government will have to take out to pay for <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s mistakes , ¡± said <PER> Dana Antasova </PER> , a 31-year - old economist on maternity leave in the north <MISC> Slovak </MISC> city <LOC> Poprad </LOC> . 

They stole everything , and now they want money from us ? ¡± 

The reason for resentment is clear . 

Salaries in the country of 5.4 million average 

only 780 euros a month ¡ª just a tad over a minimum wage of 750 euros a month in <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡ª and 

mothers like Antasova live off of a subsidy of just 11 euros a day . 

Polls show Slovaks are split evenly over whether Prime Minister <PER> Iveta Radicova </PER> ¡¯s government should ratify the expansion of the <ORG> European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> , the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s bailout fund for countries in crisis . 

A rebel party in the ruling coalition , the <ORG> liberal Freedom and Solidarity </ORG> ( <ORG> SaS </ORG> ) , is threatening to vote against on Oct. 11 . 

But while many people agree with <ORG> SaS </ORG> and say <LOC> Greece </LOC> should be allowed to go bankrupt , they are also worried that a <MISC> Slovak </MISC> ¡° no ¡± could prompt another global recession and threaten an economy that is mainly driven by exports to <MISC> euro </MISC> zone partners . 

<LOC> Slovakia </LOC> ¡¯s main highway is lined by factories owned by three big car makers and scores of other firms that flooded into the country after 1998 when reformists ousted the authoritarian government that held sway after communism . 

The auto plants produced almost 700,000 cars in 2008 just before the global financial crisis hit , making <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> the world ¡¯s biggest producer of vehicles per capita . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> and <ORG> Foxconn </ORG> also produce flat screen monitors and other electronics , a Whirlpool site cranks out white goods in the foothills of the <LOC> Tatra mountains </LOC> , and thousands of workers sweat in the forges of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> Steel in the city of <LOC> Kosice </LOC> . 

But those industries took a major hit two years ago , the same year <MISC> Slovaks </MISC> adopted the <MISC> euro </MISC> , when falling demand in the currency bloc caused a 9-month spell of double digit drops in industry and pushed unemployment to a five - year high of 13 percent . 

Now , in a rare moment of harmony , workers and industrialists have joined forces to scold their politicians for holding up the EFSF expansion , fearing that a delay could cause another painful downturn . 

¡° Even though it is difficult and <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> is not in a good social situation , ( the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) is necessary , ¡± <PER> Emil Machyna </PER> , head of the 200,000 strong industry , <ORG> transport and services union OZ KOVO </ORG> , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

¡° We need to stand in solidarity within the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone , save what can be saved and to not have a further impact on employment , a fall in production , or a new recession . ¡± 

To prepare itself for joining the <ORG> European Union </ORG> , which it joined in 2004 , and the <MISC> euro </MISC> , <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> slashed public spending , introduced a flat 19 percent tax , and sold off dozens of state - owned companies . 

A cut to long - term unemployment benefits caused riots in the country ¡¯s largely impoverished <ORG> Roma </ORG> community in 2004 , and unions are now planning a strike this week due to low salaries . 

But many say the pain was worth it . 

<LOC> Slovakia </LOC> led the <ORG> EU </ORG> in growth by expanding 10.5 percent in 2007 , and purchasing power has risen half to 74 percent of the <ORG> EU </ORG> average since 2000 , a trend businesses say is largely due to <MISC> euro </MISC> membership . 

The fact that we are exporting cars into the rest of <LOC> Europe </LOC> , the stability of the <MISC> European </MISC> economy is of the utmost importance , ¡± said <PER> Dusan Dvorak </PER> , a spokesman for <ORG> Kia autos </ORG> in <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> . 

<PER> Radicova </PER> , who has said she had a personal commitment to ratifying the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> , put it more bluntly : 

If we reject the EFSF , we can forget about economic growth . ¡± 

<ORG> SaS </ORG> leader <PER> Richard Sulik </PER> and his coalition partners argued their way out of contributing to a first <MISC> Greek </MISC> rescue package but now his party is the only one blocking the new measures . 

With 21 of the coalition ¡¯s 77 votes , it can prevent a majority in the 150 seat parliament . 

Now he complains that average paid Slovaks will have to work twice as hard as their <MISC> German </MISC> counterparts - 300 hours versus 120 for <MISC> Germans </MISC> - to pay for their part of their countries¡¯ contributions to the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> . 

¡° We will pay the highest price in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone , ¡± he told television <ORG> TA3 </ORG> on Sunday . 

Without <MISC> Slovak </MISC> ratification , the fund ¡¯s new powers ca n¡¯t go live . 

A political source said the ruling coalition ¡¯s other three parties would push through the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ¡¯s expansion with opposition support if next Tuesday ¡¯s vote fails , even if it leads to the collapse of the government or early elections . 

Employers are losing their patience . 

¡° We appeal to all political parties that are fundamentally rejecting a joint and coordinated approach in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone to realise that their stance is very bad and one that <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> can not afford to take , ¡± said <ORG> Klub </ORG> 500 , an association of 500 businesses that employ more than 80,000 workers . 

<LOC> Slovakia </LOC> still trails countries like <LOC> Greece </LOC> , where purchasing power is 89 percent of the bloc ¡¯s . 

People like <PER> Marta Brnova </PER> worry that failure to pass the EFSF could end the game of catch up . 

¡° It would hit us for sure , ¡± said <PER> Brnova </PER> , a 26-year - old receptionist for <PER> Johnson </PER> Controls , a company that is part of the huge car industry supply chain . 

And after all this work , we do n¡¯t want some other country to overtake us . 

In <LOC> Bratislava </LOC> , people rejoiced two years ago when their crown currency vanished and their bank machines started spitting out the same euros they could get half an hour away in <LOC> Vienna </LOC> . 

It was a small victory for a nation that trailed its larger former federation partner , the <LOC> Czech Republic </LOC> , in terms of economic performance and international image after the two split in the so - called ¡° Velvet Divorce ¡± in 1993 . 

After a decade of playing troublemaker on the <ORG> European Union ¡¯s eastern frontier </ORG> in the 1990 ¡¯s under xenophobic and diplomatically isolated former Prime Minister <PER> Vladimir Meciar </PER> , many <MISC> Slovaks </MISC> cringe at the idea of rocking the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone boat . 

Generally , we condemn the populism that some political parties are engaging in , ¡± said <PER> Miroslav Gazdik </PER> , head of <ORG> KOZ </ORG> , the umbrella group that <ORG> represents all union </ORG> members in <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> ¡¯s 2 million strong workforce . 

¡° I think that , as a small country , we ca n¡¯t behave like the bellybutton of the world . 

If we want to exist in the community and use certain benefits we have contribute with something to the club .

Shares of <ORG> Starwood </ORG> and other hotel companies have been hit hard because of uncertainty in the <MISC> European </MISC> markets and fears of a potential recession , the article said . 

The <ORG> Barron ¡¯s </ORG> article cites one portfolio manager as valuing <ORG> Starwood </ORG> shares at $ 81 . 

If you like to watch big , multi - national entertainment companies count gobs of money and boast about who has more , we are fast approaching that time of year . 

both reaching the $ 1 billion mark in domestic box - office revenue over the weekend , the overall 2011 revenue horse race is shaping up to be a close one between Paramount and <ORG> Warner Bros. </ORG> ( see chart from BoxOfficeMojo.com below ) . 

<PER> Warner </PER> is trying to secure a fourth consecutive year of market - share dominance and is currently ahead of No . 2 Paramount by $ 47.7 million . 

But <ORG> Paramount </ORG> has number of notable fourth - quarter releases upcoming , starting next week with its " Footloose " remake , continuing on through part three of its very bankable " Paranormal Activity " franchise , as well as its next <ORG> DreamWorks </ORG> Animation distribution project , " Puss In Boots . " 

<ORG> Paramount </ORG> also has two big family adventure movies coming up with <PER> Martin Scorsese </PER> 's " <PER> Hugo </PER> " and <PER> Steven Spielberg </PER> 's " The <MISC> Adventures of Tintin </MISC> . " 

For its part , <PER> Warner </PER> has sequels to " <PER> Harold </PER> and <PER> Kumar </PER> , " " Happy Feet " and " <PER> Sherlock Holmes </PER> , " but will probably finish second based on remaining volume alone . 

Another interesting race : not to finish last . 

Universal , which has finished in the cellar in domestic revenue among Big 6 studios the last two years , is $ 152.9 million ahead of <PER> Fox </PER> through this weekend . 

Universal 's upcoming slate includes a prequel to the horror - <MISC> sci classic </MISC> " The Thing , " another " <MISC> Johnny English </MISC> " comedy , and the <PER> Brett Ratner </PER> action - comedy " Tower Heist . " 

<PER> Fox </PER> 's fourth - quarter lineup could be potent , however , starting with <PER> David Frankel </PER> ensemble comedy " The Big Year " next weekend .

Investors tiring of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis dragging the market all over the place are hoping to focus on something else this week ¡ª earnings . 

But will third - quarter results be enough to drive the <ORG> S&P </ORG> 500 higher ? 

Or will <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s woes get in the way ? 

The unofficial start of earnings season begins on Tuesday , when <MISC> Dow </MISC> component <ORG> Alcoa Inc </ORG> reports third - quarter results after the close of trading . 

The earnings and guidance that may follow could give investors some clues on the health of the global economy , including any impact the <MISC> euro </MISC> - zone debt crisis has had and might continue to have on profits . 

But even if earnings paint a rosier picture than anticipated , stocks may face a stiff test in climbing much further , as analysts pointed to the declining 50-day moving average as a key resistance point that could limit gains . 

Last week ¡¯s sharp gains were built on improved hopes that <MISC> European </MISC> officials will get a handle on the <MISC> euro </MISC> - zone debt crisis . 

That fed a massive bout of short - covering as those betting against stocks were forced to buy shares to avoid losing money . 

The benchmark <ORG> S&P </ORG> 500 index 

rose 2.1 percent for the past week , buoyed by a 6 percent jump mid - week , as it appeared plans in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone to get a grip on the debt crisis were moving forward . 

The region remains a wild card , which could cause any gains to quickly vanish . 

For the next three weeks , in this country , earnings will be the focus and the subplot is going to be <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡ª <LOC> Europe </LOC> is always going to be just under the surface , ¡± said <PER> Ken Polcari </PER> , managing director at <ORG> ICAP </ORG> Equities in <LOC> New York </LOC> . 

¡° But if all of a sudden in the middle of next week , some catastrophe happens in <LOC> Europe </LOC> , the focus is immediately going to be headline driven and goes back to <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

Other companies expected to post quarterly results this week include <ORG> PepsiCo Inc </ORG> , tech giant <ORG> Google Inc </ORG> , <ORG> JPMorgan Chase & Co </ORG> and toy maker <ORG> Mattel Inc </ORG> . 

Clouding the picture for profits is the fact that many earnings estimates have been trimmed by analysts in light of the turmoil in <LOC> Europe </LOC> , a staggering global economy and other events which resulted in a more cautious forecast . 

¡° You ¡¯ve got to remember what was going on in July with the debt - ceiling crisis , credit default ¡ª companies were not willing to go out on a limb and make any big expectations , ¡± said <PER> Marc Pado </PER> , a <LOC> U.S. </LOC> market strategist at <ORG> Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. </ORG> in <LOC> San Francisco </LOC> . 

So they were conservative going in , and we have not seen a whole lot of downward revisions , which suggests companies are probably going to be able to make those numbers . 

The economic calendar for this week includes the FOMC minutes from the two - day meeting in late September , along with import prices and retail sales for September , in addition to the preliminary reading on October consumer sentiment from the <ORG> Thomson Reuters / University of Michigan </ORG> surveys . 

Economic data of late has been better than expected , helping to quell fears that the economy was headed for a double - dip recession . 

Once again , that leaves the <MISC> euro </MISC> - zone crisis as a potential landmine to disrupt a slow move higher . 

¡° The reason we have lifted in the past week is the rhetoric has improved and we are seeing progress , not necessarily a plan , but you are getting countries to admit to the problem , and that is a step in the right direction ¡ª 

you have to seek help before you can get help , ¡± <PER> Pado </PER> said . 

¡° That is all we really need in order to get beyond this , and start focusing on the future and focusing on our own data .

* <ORG> Osmond ¡¯s Sun Capital </ORG> remain in talks over <ORG> Lloyds branches </ORG> - source 

* Newspaper said <PER> Osmond </PER> pulled out <ORG> Lloyds </ORG> of branches sale 

* Costs associated with bid proving tricky for <ORG> Sun Capital </ORG> - source 

<PER> Hugh Osmond </PER> ¡¯s <ORG> Sun Capital Partners </ORG> remains in talks over buying some 630 <ORG> Lloyds retail bank </ORG> branches , although <ORG> Sun Capital </ORG> has concerns over the costs of a bid , said a source with knowledge of the matter . 

¡° We remain in dialogue , but there is the issue of costs , which is more than Lloyds¡¯ internal estimate , ¡± said the source , who declined to be identified . 

The Sunday Telegraph had earlier reported that <ORG> Sun Capital </ORG> had withdrawn from the race to buy the branches . 

The newspaper said it understood Sun Capital was ¡° unlikely ¡± to enter a second - round bid for the branches , which <ORG> Lloyds </ORG> has been ordered to sell by <MISC> European </MISC> regulators after the bank was rescued by the <MISC> British </MISC> taxpayer . 

New <MISC> British </MISC> bank venture <ORG> NBNK </ORG> confirmed last month that it had submitted a second - round bid , said to be worth 1.5 billion pounds ( $ 2.3 billion ) , for the branches . 

<ORG> Co </ORG> - operative Financial Services was also still in the running , it said last month , although it had not yet submitted a second - round bid . 

<ORG> Lloyds </ORG> declined to comment on the report . 

<LOC> Britain </LOC> ended up with a 40.6 percent stake in <ORG> Lloyds </ORG> and 83 percent of <ORG> Royal Bank of Scotland </ORG> after rescuing both during the credit crisis with taxpayer bailouts , and <ORG> RBS </ORG> has also been told to sell off a host of assets . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <ORG> Vodafone </ORG> on Sunday launched a broadside against 3 , its smaller rival in the <MISC> British </MISC> mobile market , over the increasingly controversial auction of next - generation 4 G mobile spectrum . 

<MISC> British </MISC> regulator Ofcom on Friday delayed the launch of the auction by six months to the end of next year 

so it could again consult on the rules , which have been the subject of heated argument among the four network operators and other interested parties . 

Ofcom had proposed strict limits on the amount of spectrum an operator could buy in a bid to protect the smallest operator , <ORG> Hutchison ¡¯s </ORG> 3 . 

3 is opposed to a delay in the process because it is at risk of running out of capacity on its 3 G network , where demand is booming thanks to network - hungry handsets like the iPhone . 

With no 2 G spectrum , 3 can not take advantage of Ofcom ¡¯s January decision to allow operators to reuse 2 G spectrum for 3 G services . 

<LOC> UK </LOC> chief executive <PER> Guy Lawrence </PER> told the Sunday Telegraph that 3 was ¡° running around the playground complaining that they ¡¯re being bullied by the older boys ¡± , when in fact the operator sold more <ORG> Apple </ORG> iPhones than <ORG> Vodafone </ORG> , <ORG> O2 </ORG> , or Everything , Everywhere . 

A 3 spokesman told the newspaper that the auction could not be viewed in isolation . 

¡° It is intended to address the massive competitive and commercial imbalance created by the decision in January , ¡± was is quoted as saying . 

Call it what you will , but as predicted in one of my previous posts , " Online Piracy 's Silver Lining , " the mainstream media 's marketing forces can not resist the temptation of turnkey access to large consumers bases . 

The 

<ORG> Rhapsody music service </ORG> announced last week that it has agreed to purchase 

<PER> Napster </PER> 's subscribers from Best Buy , who acquired the company for $ 121 million in 2008 . 

Operators of online piracy sites should take note ¡ª 

you could be sitting on the next media gold rush . 

If you operate a pirating site ( or know somebody who does ) , here 's a quick " how to " guide for scrubbing your subscribers : 

1 . Consolidate your massive ill - gotten subscriber database and corresponding consumer metrics ; 

Convert the site into a legitimate commercial enterprise ; 

Cease pirating and start retailing ; 

If unsuccessful , sell yourself to the highest bidder : big media , technology , consumer electronics , <ORG> pharma </ORG> , political parties , or whomever ; 

Become a VC , lecture on <PER> Ted </PER> , write a book . 

Former Beatle <PER> Paul McCartney </PER> will we d for the third time on Sunday when he and <LOC> New York </LOC> heiress 

<PER> Nancy Shevell </PER> are married in a civil ceremony in <LOC> London </LOC> , <MISC> British </MISC> newspapers reported . 

The Daily Mirror and the <ORG> Sun tabloids </ORG> said on Saturday that <PER> McCartney </PER> and <PER> Shevell </PER> , who posted wedding banns last month , would be married at <LOC> London </LOC> ¡¯s <LOC> Marylebone </LOC> Register Office before 30 invited guests . 

It is the same venue where <PER> McCartney </PER> married his late first wife <PER> Linda </PER> in 1969 , at the height of the Beatles¡¯ fame . 

<PER> Linda </PER> died of breast cancer in 1998 . 

They have been given special dispensation by the council to marry on Sunday and have chosen what would have been the groom ¡¯s former bandmate <PER> John Lennon </PER> ¡¯s 71st birthday for their big day , ¡± the <ORG> Daily Mirror </ORG> said . 

<PER> McCartney </PER> ¡¯s partnership with <PER> Lennon </PER> in 1960s <LOC> Britain </LOC> produced some of the most famous and enduring pop songs of the past 50 years . 

A spokesman for <PER> McCartney </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> in an email : ¡° We are not commenting . 

The <ORG> Daily Mirror </ORG> quoted a source close to <PER> McCartney </PER> as saying : ¡° The wedding is in keeping with the way <PER> Paul </PER> and <PER> Nancy </PER> have conducted their entire relationship ¡ª low - key , understated and fueled by goodwill . 

Neither of them want a huge fuss made and the main priority for both was family . 

The wedding will be followed by a reception held in <PER> McCartney </PER> ¡¯s back garden , the paper said . 

<PER> Shevell </PER> , 51 , who is divorced , and <PER> McCartney </PER> , 69 , are believed to have begun dating after his bitter split with second wife , former model <PER> Heather Mills </PER> . 

<PER> McCartney </PER> and Mills were we d in 2002 in a lavish ceremony at <LOC> Castle Leslie </LOC> in <LOC> Ireland </LOC> estimated by celebrity magazines to have cost around $ 3.2 million . 

But four years later they confirmed they had separated , blaming media intrusion into their private lives , and in 2008 the couple divorced . 

<PER> McCartney </PER> has a son , two daughters and a stepdaughter from his marriage to <PER> Linda </PER> and a daughter from his union with Mills .

<LOC> BERLIN </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> will present proposals on a new comprehensive package for stabilising the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone by the end of the month , <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> said on Sunday . 

¡° We are very conscious that <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> have a particular responsibility for stabilising the <MISC> euro </MISC> , ¡± <PER> Sarkozy </PER> said at a joint news conference with Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> . 

¡° We need to deliver a response that is sustainable and comprehensive . 

We have decided to provide this response by the end of the month because <LOC> Europe </LOC> must solve its problems by the G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> , ¡± he added , saying it was too early to enter into details . 

The leaders suggested that their proposals would include a plan for recapitalising <MISC> European </MISC> banks , accelerating economic coordination in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone and dealing with <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s debt problems . 

A former Miss <LOC> Iceland </LOC> who met <LOC> Boston </LOC> crime boss 

<PER> Whitey </PER> ¡± <PER> Bulger </PER> and his girl friend in <LOC> California </LOC> was paid a $ 2 million reward for the tip that led to <PER> Bulger </PER> ¡¯s arrest in June , the <ORG> Boston Globe </ORG> said on Sunday . 

The <ORG> Federal Bureau of Investigation </ORG> paid the reward money to <PER> Anna Bjornsdottir </PER> , a one - time model and Miss <LOC> Iceland </LOC> 1974 who had gotten to know <PER> Bulger </PER> ¡¯s girl friend <PER> Catherine Greig </PER> after the two women 

both took a shared interest in a local stray cat while the fugitive couple hid out in <LOC> Santa Monica </LOC> . 

<PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> had assumed new identities during more than a decade on the run from federal charges , and appeared to neighbors to be a modest retired couple . 

But it was Bjornsdottir , the newspaper reported , who recognized <PER> Bulger </PER> in a news report this summer while she was back in <LOC> Reykjavik </LOC> and called authorities . 

After the tip , <PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> were arrested in June without incident at their <LOC> Santa Monica </LOC> apartment building in June . 

Property records showed they moved into a two - bedroom unit in April 1998 , playing $ 863 a month . 

Authorities have said they found about 30 firearms and $ 822,000 in cash hidden in the walls of their apartment . 

The <ORG> FBI </ORG> had said in September it had paid $ 2.1 million to ¡° more than one individual ¡± for information that led to the arrests of <PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> , but had not given more detail . 

The newspaper reported <ORG> Bjornsdottir </ORG> had collected $ 2 million of the $ 2.1 million in <ORG> FBI </ORG> rewards for her tip . 

A call to the <ORG> FBI ¡¯s Boston office </ORG> was not immediately returned on Sunday . 

<PER> Bulger </PER> had fled <LOC> Boston </LOC> after hearing from a corrupt FBI agent that he was about to be indicted . 

<PER> Greig </PER> joined him a short time later and has been charged with harboring <PER> Bulger </PER> as a fugitive . 

Past <LOC> Boston </LOC> FBI officials had used <PER> Bulger </PER> as an informant for years against other organized crime factions and , later investigations found , tolerated or enabled his own ongoing criminal activities in what an appeals court in a related case earlier this year termed an ¡° unholy alliance . ¡± 

<PER> Bulger </PER> , who for years led the <LOC> Boston </LOC> - based Winter <LOC> Hill Gang </LOC> , faces charges that include 19 alleged murders from the 1970s and 1980s . 

Both <PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them . 

Through her husband , <PER> Bjornsdottir </PER> declined to speak to the Globe , the newspaper said . 

She had moved to Southern <LOC> California </LOC> in the late 1970 ¡¯s and appeared in cosmetics commercials . 

More recently she had befriended <PER> Greig </PER> after noticing her feeding a local cat , the paper reported .

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <PER> Willie Walsh </PER> , chief executive of <ORG> British Airways </ORG> owner International Airline Group , has poured cold water on a plan to link <LOC> London </LOC> ¡¯s <LOC> Heathrow </LOC> and <LOC> Gatwick </LOC> airports by high - speed rail . 

The <MISC> British </MISC> government said on Saturday that it was considering connecting the airports ¡ª creating a virtual hub dubbed Heathwick ¡ª to increase capacity in the <LOC> London </LOC> aviation market after it rejected a third runway at <LOC> Heathrow </LOC> . 

The challenges ( Heathwick ) faces are very significant , ¡± <PER> Walsh </PER> told the Sunday Telegraph . 

I do n¡¯t know how long it would take to develop . 

I do n¡¯t know how much it would cost . ¡± 

<PER> Walsh </PER> said he believed that shelving the plan for a third runway at <LOC> Heathrow </LOC> , which would have been funded by the airlines using the airport , would be viewed in future years as a ¡° huge mistake ¡± . 

The Heathwick scheme , which was reported by the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> to cost 5 billion pounds ( $ 7.8 billion ) , would be included in the Government ¡¯s review of aviation policy in spring 2012 , a Department for Transport spokesman said on Saturday .

<PER> Frederic Prinz von Anhalt </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> the 94-year - old celebrity who has suffered ill health for well over a year was taking ¡° very strong antibiotics ¡± and that her blood pressure was down . 

<PER> Gabor </PER> was taken to the hospital Saturday morning and <PER> von Anhalt </PER> said at the time that her condition ¡° did not look good , ¡± but she has since stabilized . 

He said doctors likely would attempt the stomach surgery later on Sunday . 

<PER> Gabor </PER> has been hospitalized numerous times since July 2010 , when she fell out of bed and broke her hip .

<LOC> CAIRO </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Egypt </LOC> ¡¯s ruling military council has amended election rules to ban the use of religious slogans , a move the <ORG> Muslim Brotherhood </ORG> said Sunday may prompt it to reconsider using its traditional campaign phrase ¡° <MISC> Islam </MISC> is the solution . ¡± 

The <ORG> Brotherhood </ORG> was banned under the ousted President <PER> Hosni Mubarak </PER> but ran candidates as ¡° independents , ¡± who could be identified on posters by the <MISC> Islamist </MISC> group ¡¯s well - known slogan . 

Many liberal politicians and <MISC> Egyptians </MISC> have been worried by the rising influence of the <ORG> Brotherhood </ORG> since the uprising . 

The group has sought to quell concerns by saying it wants a pluralist democracy and did not want to impose <MISC> Islamic </MISC> law . 

¡° Electoral campaigns based on the use of religious slogans or on racial or gender segregation are banned , ¡± a military council decree issued late Saturday said , adding violators could face three months in jail and be fined . 

The election committee earlier said the <ORG> Brotherhood ¡¯s Freedom and Justice party </ORG> could not use the slogan , prompting some members to insist it should be allowed . 

But <ORG> Brotherhood </ORG> officials took a softer line after the army decree . 

but it is n¡¯t necessarily an electoral slogan , ¡± <PER> Mohamed el </PER> - <PER> Beltagy </PER> , a senior figure in the <ORG> Freedom and Justice party </ORG> , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> after the decree . 

¡° We might reconsider using it in the elections in light of the conditions and might replace it , ¡± with other slogans , he said . 

The <ORG> Brotherhood </ORG> has been more accommodating of the army than some activists , which analysts say is because it does not want to disrupt an election process that will strengthen its role and prevent a return to repression it faced under <PER> Mubarak </PER> . 

Voting in a parliamentary election starts on November 28 . 

<MISC> Egyptian </MISC> law bars political parties based on religion , just as it did under <PER> Mubarak </PER> . 

But the <ORG> Brotherhood ¡¯s Freedom and Justice party </ORG> won approval by saying <MISC> Islam </MISC> was a ¡° reference ¡± and it was a civil party that did not seek to impose <MISC> Islamic </MISC> law . 

One <MISC> Islamist </MISC> group that sought to establish a party was barred . 

The <ORG> parties¡¯ committee </ORG> said that was because it called for implementing <MISC> Islamic </MISC> law and also because one of its founders had been jailed over his role in the assassination of President <PER> Anwar Sadat </PER> in 1981 , barring him from politics . 

Despite saying the <ORG> Brotherhood </ORG> would reconsider using the slogan , <PER> Beltagy </PER> said it should be allowed under the article of the constitution that cites <MISC> Islamist </MISC> sharia law as the principle source of legislation . 

The parliament will choose an assembly to draw up a new constitution . 

Liberals are concerned that <MISC> Islamists </MISC> will dominate parliament , which will influence the contents of a new constitution . 

Analysts said the amendment to election rules reflected the <ORG> military council </ORG> ¡¯s eagerness for a civil state and worries expressed by those opposed to the <MISC> Islamists </MISC> . 

It indicates the rising concern of other civil streams who are concentrating their campaigns now , ¡± said <PER> Hossam Tammam </PER> , an expert on <MISC> Islamic </MISC> groups . 

Amendments to the election rules announced Saturday also outlined one to five - year prison terms and fines for anyone using force , threats , cash or other steps to prevent voters from casting ballots or forcing them to choose a specific candidates . 

Rights groups said such tactics were common in elections under <PER> Mubarak </PER> whose now <ORG> defunct National Democratic Party </ORG> routinely secured sweeping victories . 

The council said such punishments would also apply to those who published or circulated false information about candidates behavior with the intention of influencing voters . 

Under pressure form political parties , the <ORG> military council </ORG> has also expanded from a half to two thirds the numbers of seats elected according to party lists , reducing the seats offered to individuals . 

Parties will be able to field candidates on lists or for seats open to individuals . 

Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Shares of <ORG> Microchip Technology Inc </ORG> could be poised to rally , backed by a cheap stock valuation and a healthy dividend , according to an article in <ORG> Barron ¡¯s </ORG> .

<MISC> British </MISC> Defense Secretary <PER> Liam Fox </PER> is under pressure over reports that one of closest friends put national security at risk . 

A report into whether <PER> Fox </PER> , 50 , breached ministerial conduct rules will be handed to Prime Minister <PER> David Cameron </PER> on Monday . 

Following are some key facts on <PER> Fox </PER> : 

¡ª <PER> Fox </PER> has asked his permanent secretary to investigate claims that his links with a friend and unofficial adviser , <PER> Adam Werritty </PER> , might have threatened national security . 

The opposition <ORG> Labour Party </ORG> wants to know why he visited the <ORG> Ministry of Defense </ORG> 14 times in the past 16 months , despite him not being on its payroll and without security clearance . 

¡ª Media coverage has also questioned whether Werritty accompanied <PER> Fox </PER> on any official overseas trips . 

Although Werritty is not part of <PER> Fox </PER> ¡¯s team of officials , he is reported to have handed out embossed cards describing himself as ¡° adviser ¡± to the minister . 

¡ª Media reported at the weekend that <PER> Werritty </PER> had arranged and attended a meeting in <LOC> Dubai </LOC> in June between <PER> Fox </PER> and a company seeking to transfer communications technology . 

* <PER> Fox </PER> has served as Defense secretary since the coalition took power in May 2010 , a high profile role with almost 10,000 <MISC> British </MISC> troops in <LOC> Afghanistan </LOC> and <LOC> Britain </LOC> helping to protect civilians in <LOC> Libya </LOC> after the uprising against <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> . 

* <PER> Fox </PER> came into conflict with <PER> Cameron </PER> and Finance Minister <PER> George Osborne </PER> last year when he was fighting to protect Defense from deep budget cuts , with a series of newspaper leaks from within his department seen as part of that campaign . 

In the end , the Defense budget was cut by eight percent , against cuts of around 20 percent in most departments . 

* <PER> Fox </PER> , who is on the right of the party , won plaudits for cleaning up the finances of the department and had recently been spoken of again as an eventual long - term successor to <PER> Cameron </PER> . 

He describes himself as a ¡° hawk on Defense and on the deficit ¡± . 

* He stood for the party leadership in 2005 and was defeated by <PER> Cameron </PER> . 

His political leanings were in evidence last month when former Prime Minister <PER> Margaret Thatcher </PER> made a rare public appearance at his 50th birthday party . 

¡ª <PER> Fox </PER> , who has a taste for publicity , was pictured in an electric blue shirt ¡ª 

the color of the Conservative Party ¡ª holding the arm of the frail former premier . 

* Born in September 1961 and brought up in <LOC> Scotland </LOC> , <PER> Fox </PER> studied medicine at the <ORG> University of Glasgow </ORG> and became president of the <ORG> University ¡¯s Conservative and Unionist Association </ORG> . 

* He worked as a Civilian Army Medical Officer and as a general practitioner . 

* He became a Conservative MP in 1992 for <LOC> Woodspring </LOC> , and for <LOC> North Somerset </LOC> since the May 2010 general election . 

( Reporting by <PER> Keith Weir </PER> and <PER> David Cutler </PER> , <LOC> London </LOC> Editorial Reference Unit ) 

The fate of <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s Defense Secretary <PER> Liam Fox </PER> may be decided next week after claims his relationship with a close friend and unofficial adviser may have breached national security . 

The role of defense secretary is particularly sensitive in <LOC> Britain </LOC> because of the involvement of about 10,000 <MISC> British </MISC> troops in <LOC> Afghanistan </LOC> and its role in helping <ORG> NATO </ORG> protect civilians in <LOC> Libya </LOC> after the uprising against <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> . 

<PER> Fox </PER> returned to <LOC> Britain </LOC> on Sunday from <LOC> Libya </LOC> where his first visit to the country was overshadowed by the saga . 

Prime Minister <PER> David Cameron </PER> has demanded the initial findings of an inquiry arrive on his desk on Monday after media furor surrounding his minister ¡¯s ties with a former flatmate and best man at his wedding , <PER> Adam Werritty </PER> , refused to go away . 

Although <PER> Cameron </PER> has said he has ¡° full confidence ¡± in <PER> Fox </PER> 

, the 48-hour deadline was shorter than the two - week deadline <PER> Fox </PER> gave a top military civil servant to carry it out . 

One defense analyst said <PER> Fox </PER> , who has been defense secretary since the Conservative - led coalition came to power in 2010 , would fight to keep his job , saying <PER> Fox </PER> ¡¯s behavior was more a case of poor judgment than a risk to national security . 

But the opposition is calling for a wider inquiry , and will push for <PER> Fox </PER> to make an emergency statement to parliament on Monday , where he is already due to answer defense questions . 

not just the questions of <ORG> national security </ORG> and access to highly sensitive information . 

It ¡¯s also the question of the probity and procurement , ¡± <PER> Harriet Harman </PER> , deputy Labour leader , told <ORG> BBC </ORG> television on Sunday . 

But there ¡¯s now a further question about Dr <PER> Fox </PER> ¡¯s integrity and the question of whether he actually answered truthfully and fully all the questions that have been put . 

<PER> Fox </PER> , on the right of <PER> Cameron </PER> ¡¯s Conservatives and seen as a leadership challenger , is skeptical on <LOC> Europe </LOC> and in favor of close cooperation with the <LOC> United States </LOC> on defense issues . 

His departure would leave <PER> Cameron </PER> searching for someone of similar political leanings to avoid accusations that his coalition with the Liberal <MISC> Democrats </MISC> was getting dragged too far into the center ground of <MISC> British </MISC> politics . 

<PER> Werritty </PER> ¡¯s 14 visits to the ministry in the past 16 months , without security clearance and despite not being on its payroll , are being questioned as well as whether he accompanied <PER> Fox </PER> on official overseas trips , and set up business meetings , including one in <LOC> Dubai </LOC> in June , where ministry officials were not present . 

Although Werritty is not part of <PER> Fox </PER> ¡¯s team of officials , he is reported to have handed out embossed cards describing himself as ¡° adviser ¡± to the minister . 

In <LOC> Misrata </LOC> , <PER> Fox </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> , when asked if the coverage was overshadowing his role as defense secretary : ¡° 

Well , of course , that ¡¯s what those who raised the stories intended 

and they ¡¯re allowed to do that in a <MISC> democratic </MISC> society . 

He described the claims as ¡° utterly baseless . ¡± 

<PER> Fox </PER> , who stood against <PER> Cameron </PER> for party leadership in 2005 , came into conflict with him again last year as leaks emerged when his department successfully fought deep budget cuts . 

<PER> Fox </PER> ¡¯s status among defense chiefs took a dent though when he blamed them for overspending , but he won plaudits in other circles for cleaning up the department ¡¯s finances . 

A retired senior military official , who declined to be named said : ¡° If there is any real substance to this story , that may undermine his position , but so far , I ¡¯m not convinced there is . 

Every minister ¡¯s got mates who he deals with , who they use as their confidantes . 

Defense analyst <PER> Paul Beaver </PER> said : ¡° We will look back at his tenure as defense secretary in a decade ¡¯s time and will remember what was a very successful campaign ( <LOC> Libya </LOC> ) . 

He is a fighter , I think he firmly believes he has done nothing of a resignation issue .

President <PER> Ellen Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> , who shared this year ¡¯s <MISC> Nobel Peace Prize </MISC> , faces chief rival <PER> Winston Tubman </PER> and 14 others in the second presidential vote since the end of fighting that killed 200,000 people and left <LOC> Liberia </LOC> in ruins . 

<ORG> Chevron </ORG> , <ORG> Anadarko </ORG> and others are drilling for offshore oil this year , steel giant <ORG> ArcelorMittal </ORG> is a few weeks into its first local iron ore production , and <LOC> Liberia </LOC> ¡¯s first gold shipments are due soon . 

¡° We will resist any attempt by anyone to bring war in this country , ¡± said <PER> Isaac Jensen </PER> , a student at the University of <LOC> Liberia </LOC> in the capital <LOC> Monrovia </LOC> , a sprawl of tattered buildings and tin - roofed shanties on the edge of the <LOC> Atlantic </LOC> . 

¡° We are tired of war and if anyone thinks of coming with war , that person will be the first to die . 

<PER> Rufus Yarmie </PER> , a resident of Tappita in <LOC> Liberia </LOC> ¡¯s northeast , said a peaceful vote was more important in a country where average income is around $ 300 a year than who actually won . 

¡° We are more concerned about peace and acceptability of the results by all parties , ¡± he said by telephone . 

Citing persistent violent crime , instability in neighboring <LOC> Ivory </LOC> Coast and drug and arms trafficking across the region , the <ORG> U.N. Security Council </ORG> last month extended the mandate of the 9,200-strong peacekeeping mission <ORG> UNMIL </ORG> . 

Underlining the fragility of <LOC> Liberia </LOC> ¡¯s calm , mercenaries from <LOC> Ivory Coast </LOC> ¡¯s civil war earlier this year conducted raids on <MISC> Ivorian </MISC> border towns in September , leading regional countries to form a joint peacekeeping force . 

Reminders of <LOC> Liberia </LOC> ¡¯s own 14 years of fighting , which ran until 2003 , are everywhere ¡ª a <ORG> U.N. </ORG> armored personnel carrier in front of the <ORG> Ministry of Foreign affairs </ORG> , war - wounded begging in the streets , bullet - riddled buildings . 

Both <PER> Tubman </PER> and <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> are from the higher echelons of society . 

<PER> Tubman </PER> as one of the <PER> Americo </PER> - <MISC> Liberians </MISC> who dominated much of its history after its 1847 founding by freed <LOC> U.S. </LOC> slaves . 

While <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> is not <PER> Americo </PER> - <MISC> Liberian </MISC> herself , her mother and father were both raised by <PER> Americo </PER> - <MISC> Liberians </MISC> . 

<PER> Tubman </PER> , a Harvard - educated nephew of former president <PER> William Tubman </PER> and a former senior <ORG> U.N. </ORG> diplomat , is expected by many Liberians to give <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> her toughest challenge . 

His running mate is superstar soccer player <PER> George Weah </PER> , who lost to <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> in 2005 . 

<PER> Tubman </PER> vows to accept the results of a free and fair vote , but also says he is ¡° 100 percent certain ¡± of victory and that anyone else claiming a win could find it difficult to govern . 

¡° These tens of thousands you have seen in <LOC> Monrovia </LOC> and other places demonstrating and clamoring with passion for us 

, they will not accept being cheated , ¡± he said in an interview with <ORG> Reuters </ORG> on Saturday . 

The <ORG> Carter Center </ORG> , a <LOC> U.S </LOC> .- based democracy watchdog , described campaigning as ¡° vibrant ¡± but cautioned it had observed opposition parties being refused the use of public facilities and the ruling party using public resources for campaigning . 

If <PER> Sirleaf </PER> does win , it wo n¡¯t be an easy victory . 

Violence ca n¡¯t be ruled out , especially considering the tone of the campaigns in recent weeks and reports that opposition parties have been denied access to public facilities , ¡± said <PER> Titi Ajayi </PER> , analyst at International Crisis Group . 

<PER> Sirleaf </PER> ¡¯s <MISC> Nobel Prize </MISC> could give her a boost at the polls ¡ª and even the absolute majority needed to win in the first round ¡ª particularly if it succeeds in galvanizing the women ¡¯s vote behind her , analysts said . 

( It ) gives her a distinct advantage over her rivals , provided poor Liberians understand what it means and how it affects their lives for the better , ¡± said <PER> Lydie Boka </PER> , head of <LOC> France </LOC> - based risk consultancy StrategiCo . 

¡° <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> is a symbol in a continent where women are not on the forefront to say the least . ¡± 

Speaking at a rally on Sunday , <MISC> Liberian </MISC> women rights activist and fellow <MISC> Nobel </MISC> laureate <PER> Leymah Gbowee </PER> publicly endorsed <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> for president ¡ª potentially raising her chances of securing the female vote . 

But her critics have said the prize is evidence only of her international fame ¡ª not her domestic record , which includes controversy over her temporary support to a rebellion by notorious warlord <PER> Charles Taylor </PER> against ex - president <PER> Samuel Doe </PER> and impatience with the slow pace of reconstruction . 

A former Citigroup and World Bank economist , <PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> became <MISC> African </MISC> ¡¯s first freely elected head of state in 2005 , earning support from the <LOC> United States </LOC> , and has convinced donors to write off billions of dollars of the country ¡¯s debt . 

She has admitted providing food , supplies and financing to <PER> Charles Taylor </PER> , notorious for his child armies and now facing war crimes charges at the <LOC> Hague </LOC> , but said that she cut off her support once she understood more about what he was doing . 

<PER> Johnson </PER> - <PER> Sirleaf </PER> will also face off against former warlord <PER> Prince Johnson </PER> , whose fighters captured and killed Doe . 

¡° Once the elections are conducted in a free and fair manner , I will accept the result . 

We have only this country to protect , ¡± <PER> Prince Johnson </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> last week .

A cyclical drop in the <ORG> sun ¡¯s </ORG> radiation can trigger unusually cold winters in parts of <LOC> North America </LOC> and <LOC> Europe </LOC> , scientists say , a finding that could improve long - range forecasts and help countries prepare for blizzards . 

Scientists have known for a long time that the <ORG> sun </ORG> has an 11-year cycle during which radiation measured by sunspots on the surface reaches a peak then falls . 

But pinning down a clear link to weather has proved harder . 

¡° Our research confirms the observed link between solar variability and regional winter climate , ¡± lead author <PER> Sarah Ineson </PER> of the <LOC> UK </LOC> Met Office told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> in an email . 

The study was published in the <ORG> journal Nature Geoscience </ORG> on Monday . 

Her team focused on data from the recent solar minimum during 2008 - 10 , a period of unusual calm for the sun and intense winters in the <LOC> United States </LOC> and parts of <LOC> Europe </LOC> that shut down air travel and disrupted businesses . 

The researchers found that a reduction in ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation from the sun can affect high - altitude wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere , triggering cold winters . 

While UV levels wo n¡¯t tell us what the day - to - day weather will do , they provide the exciting prospect of improved forecasts for winter conditions for months and even years ahead . 

These forecasts play an important role in long - term contingency planning , ¡± <PER> Ineson </PER> , a climate scientist , said . 

<PER> Ineson </PER> and colleagues from the <ORG> Imperial College London and the University of Oxford </ORG> used satellite data that more accurately measures UV radiation from the sun and found a much greater variability than previously thought . 

They found that in years of low activity , unusually cold air forms high in the atmosphere over the tropics . 

This causes a redistribution of heat in the atmosphere , triggering easterly winds that bring freezing weather and snow storms to northern <LOC> Europe </LOC> and the <LOC> United States </LOC> and milder weather to <LOC> Canada </LOC> and the <LOC> Mediterranean </LOC> . 

When solar UV radiation is stronger , the opposite occurs . 

<PER> Ineson </PER> ¡¯s team used the data in a complex computer model that simulates long - term weather patterns . 

The model successfully reproduced what scientists have observed happening in the upper atmosphere during changes in solar radiation . 

A key uncertainty in the experiment lay in the satellite data used , because it spans only a few years . 

So questions remain concerning both accuracy and also applicability to other solar cycles , ¡± she said . 

<ORG> FRANKFURT </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <PER> Eckhard Cordes </PER> , chief executive of <MISC> German </MISC> retailer <ORG> Metro MEOG.DE </ORG> , said he no longer wishes to renew his contract , just weeks after winning support from the group ¡¯s top shareholder . 

<PER> Cordes </PER> had seemed in danger of losing his job last month after reports that he had fallen out of favor with some supervisory board members , who were due to vote later in the autumn on whether his contract would be extended past October 2012 . 

However , he battled for support among other members of the board and in a rare public statement , the <PER> Haniel </PER> family , which owns 34.24 percent of <ORG> Metro </ORG> , said they were in favor of a contract extension for <ORG> Cordes </ORG> . 

<PER> Cordes </PER> , who informed the supervisory board and major shareholders of his decision on Sunday , criticized the public debate over his contract , saying it threatened to harm the company , its principal shareholders and himself . 

Due to the incidents of the recent weeks and months I have come to the conclusion that the trustful basis to stay on as the head of <LOC> Metro </LOC> ¡¯s top management does not anymore exist , ¡± he said in a statement on Sunday . 

The <ORG> Metro </ORG> share price has also slumped 38 percent this year on fears of lackluster consumer spending and as sales dropped at one - time star performer MediaMarkt - <ORG> Saturn </ORG> , the chain of consumer electronics stores majority owned by the group . 

A source close to the company said <PER> Cordes </PER> would not leave <LOC> Metro </LOC> straight away and would stay on until a succession process had been decided . 

A separate source also close to the company said that <PER> Cordes </PER> was likely to leave over the <MISC> European </MISC> winter and that current Chief Financial Officer <PER> Olaf Koch </PER> might take the helm on an interim basis until a new chief executive were found . 

The <PER> Haniel </PER> family , which holds the <ORG> Metro </ORG> stake via the <ORG> Franz Haniel & Cie </ORG> investment company , said in a statement that Cordes¡¯ decision merited ¡° our recognition and respect . 

The <PER> Schmidt </PER> - <PER> Ruthenbeck </PER> family , who own around 16 percent of <ORG> Metro </ORG> and were also in favor of a contract extension for <PER> Cordes </PER> , said on Sunday they regretted <PER> Cordes¡¯ </PER> decision . 

¡° We believe <PER> Cordes </PER> staying would have been best for the further development of <LOC> Metro </LOC> . 

Therefore we would like him if possible to stay until his contract expires , ¡± said <PER> Peter Kuepfer </PER> , who represents the family on the <ORG> Metro supervisory board </ORG> .

* Yang wants to take Yahoo off public markets - sources 

* Talks with private equity still informal , no firm offers 

* <PER> Yang </PER> ¡¯s influence has waned since 2008 <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> bid 

By <PER> Peter Lauria </PER> , <PER> Alexei Oreskovic </PER> and <PER> Nadia Damouni </PER> 

<LOC> NEW YORK </LOC> / <LOC> SAN FRANCISCO </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - 

For the last few years , a widely circulated joke about <PER> Jerry Yang </PER> was that he had the best tan in <LOC> Silicon Valley </LOC> from all the time he spent on <LOC> Stanford University ¡¯s golf </LOC> course . 

But the jests stopped about six months ago , when the <ORG> Yahoo Inc co </ORG> - founder and former CEO put away his golf clubs and began showing up on a daily basis at the <MISC> Internet </MISC> company ¡¯s headquarters in <LOC> Sunnyvale </LOC> , <LOC> California </LOC> , according to a high - ranking <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> executive . 

Now , Yang is interested in a deal with private equity firms that would take the $ 20 billion company off public markets , according to people familiar with the situation . 

Such a deal would involve rolling over Yang ¡¯s stake in <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , which stood at 3.63 percent as of April 2 . 

<ORG> Yahoo ¡¯s other co </ORG> - founder , <PER> David Filo </PER> , would likely follow Yang ¡¯s lead and roll over his stake , said other sources close to <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> . 

<ORG> Filo </ORG> held 5.90 percent of <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s shares as of May 11 . 

Shortly after firing <PER> Carol Bartz </PER> as CEO in September , <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> and its longtime advisers at <ORG> Allen & Co </ORG> and <ORG> Goldman Sachs </ORG> began working on a strategic review , which could include a sale of the <MISC> Internet </MISC> pioneer , after receiving unsolicited expressions of interest . 

<PER> Jack Ma </PER> , CEO of <MISC> Chinese </MISC> e - commerce giant <ORG> Alibaba </ORG> , said last month that he would be ¡° very interested ¡± in buying <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , a deal that could help the former <MISC> English </MISC> school teacher expand into the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> 

<ORG> Microsoft Corp </ORG> is also considering bidding for <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , as is Silver <ORG> Lake Partners </ORG> , <ORG> Providence Equity Partners </ORG> and <ORG> Hellman & Friedman </ORG> , <ORG> Reuters </ORG> reported last week . 

Another private firm that has expressed interest in <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> is <ORG> Bain Capital </ORG> , a source said . 

<PER> Bain </PER> has invested heavily in several media companies including Clear Channel Communications and The Weather Channel in recent years . 

A <ORG> Bain </ORG> spokesman declined to comment . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> declined to detail Yang ¡¯s current role other than to say , ¡° The entire Board , including <PER> Jerry </PER> , is fully aligned and unanimous in support of the comprehensive scope of the ongoing strategic review . 

As always , <PER> Jerry ¡¯s </PER> singular focus remains to serve the best interests of <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡ª its shareholders , employees , users and advertisers . 

Three years ago , <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> offered $ 33 per share , or $ 47.5 billion , to acquire <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> . 

Yang and the board turned down that bid , to the regret of many shareholders . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s shares closed at $ 15.47 on Friday . 

Now <PER> Yang </PER> , who turns 43 in November , finds himself in essentially the same spot ¡ª trying to resuscitate an organization where a lack of operational vision and clear leadership has made it susceptible to a takeover . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s share of the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> <MISC> Internet </MISC> search market stood at 16 percent in August , compared with 19 percent two years ago , according to <ORG> ComScore </ORG> , despite a deal to outsource search technology to <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> . 

In contrast , <ORG> Google Inc </ORG> ¡¯s 

search share has been steady at 65 percent , while <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> ¡¯s share rose to 15 percent from 9 percent two years ago . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s <LOC> U.S. </LOC> display ad impressions fell to 10.2 percent in June , and time spent by users on its site increased just 1.6 percent for the 12 months ended July 2011 , according to <ORG> ComScore </ORG> . 

By comparison , Facebook ¡¯s ad impressions swelled to 32.4 percent in June 2011 and time spent by users on its site jumped 58 percent for the 12 months ended July 2011 . 

<ORG> Yahoo ¡¯s advisors </ORG> are expected to send financial information this week to interested parties , said a person familiar with the matter . 

Talks so far have been informal and have not firmed up on terms that would compel Yahoo to enter into direct negotiations , said another source . 

There are several reasons why Yang might want to take Yahoo private . 

For starters , <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> is punished by <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> for not being a growth company and its low stock price prevents shares from being used as currency for acquisitions . 

A buyer could sell off <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s international assets , which include a partnership with <ORG> Softbank </ORG> in <ORG> Yahoo Japan </ORG> as well as about 40 percent stake in <ORG> Alibaba </ORG> . 

The buyer could then use the cash ¡ª estimated to be upward of $ 12 billion ¡ª to pay off debt . 

That would pare down Yahoo to its <LOC> U.S. </LOC> operations , which has deteriorated to the point that they are being valued at just $ 5 billion and $ 6 billion , according to two sources close to the situation . 

Whether Yang will succeed in taking Yahoo private remains to be seen ¡ª it depends on the terms he manages to negotiate , as well as what other offers are on the table . 

Yang still exerts influence over the board , but he has less clout with <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> management and staff now than he did during the talks with <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> , according to current and former employees . 

Executives most loyal to Yang have matriculated out of the company over the years , replaced by a younger generation . 

Moreover , some detractors hold Yang responsible for refusing <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> in 2008 , saying his decision was influenced by his personal attachment to <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , rather than financial considerations . 

¡° The <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> decision really split the company , with many feeling that <PER> Jerry ¡¯s </PER> decision was bad for them personally because he left a lot of money on the table , ¡± said a former executive who worked at <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> at the time of the offer . 

Nevertheless , Yang still retains pockets of support inside the company . 

His supporters say he has a deep concern for the direction and culture of the business he founded with <ORG> Filo </ORG> in 1995 . 

They praised Yang for stepping in again to try to lift <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s fortunes at a difficult juncture , just as he did in 2007 when he assumed the CEO role from <PER> Terry Semel </PER> . 

<PER> Yang </PER> also has a deep network of contacts in the industry and a reputation for actively working behind the scenes . 

¡° He ¡¯d be in the office , the door would be closed , he ¡¯d be working the phones , but you would n¡¯t know who he ¡¯d be working them with , ¡± said another former <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> executive who worked closely with Yang . 

The Business Insider blog reported in September that Yang was trying to buy <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> . 

<PER> Yang </PER> , whose quiet speech and calm demeanor belie a fiercely competitive streak , has a better chance of remaining involved with <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> in a management - led buyout than an outright sale . 

But private equity firms also like to install their own management at companies they acquire . 

In pushing a go - private agenda , Yang appears to be hoping that his knowledge of <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> will be enough to convince a buyer to allow him to stay on and try to restore the company to its former glory , away from the harsh eyes of <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> . 

Many farm - related stocks look cheap considering a positive long - term outlook for the sector due to demands to feed an ever - growing global population , according to an article in <ORG> Barron ¡¯s </ORG> . 

Demographic trends suggest enticing opportunities for a wide range of companies around the world , the article said . 

Among the companies mentioned in the article are Archer - <PER> Daniels </PER> - <ORG> Midland Co </ORG> , <ORG> Bunge </ORG> , <ORG> Monsanto </ORG> and <ORG> Deere & Co </ORG> . 

¡° We welcome the decision , which confirms our interpretation of the law , ¡± an <ORG> RWE </ORG> spokesman said of the court ¡¯s ruling favouring <ORG> RWE </ORG> in a dispute over a 74 million <MISC> euro </MISC> ( $ 100 million ) tax payment on nuclear fuel at the utility ¡¯s Gundremmingen power plant . 

Various courts are handling legal challenges to <LOC> Germany </LOC> ¡¯s hasty nuclear exit and some have already expressed doubts about the government ¡¯s position . 

The <MISC> German </MISC> Finance Ministry plans to appeal a ruling by a <LOC> Hamburg </LOC> court granting a temporary injunction on the payment of the tax , the ministry said last month . 

The dispute encompasses a tax on nuclear fuel rods <ORG> RWE </ORG> says should not be levied on closed units , damages from a forced exit from a number of power stations and a constitutional court move to decide if the nuclear exit interfered with property rights .

<ORG> General Motors Co </ORG> said it was recalling about 6,000 <MISC> Chevrolet Corvette </MISC> Coupes over a concern they may fail to meet a federal safety standard covering rear hinges . 

GM said the condition could allow the rear hatch to separate from the vehicle in a crash . 

The recall involves the 2011 - 2012 model years . 

Of the affected vehicles , the majority were sold in the <LOC> United States </LOC> as well as some in <LOC> Canada </LOC> . 

GM said the issue was discovered in testing and that it knows of no crashes , injuries or customer complaints related to the issue . 

Dealers will replace both rear hatch hinges free of charge , according to the company .

<LOC> FRANKFURT </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <PER> Eckhard Cordes </PER> , chief executive of <MISC> German </MISC> retailer <ORG> Metro </ORG> , said he no longer wishes to renew his contract , just weeks after winning support from the group ¡¯s top shareholder . 

<PER> Cordes </PER> had seemed in danger of losing his job last month after reports that he had fallen out of favour with some supervisory board members , who were due to vote later in the autumn on whether his contract would be extended past October 2012 .

Therefore we would like him if possible to stay until his contract expires , ¡± said <PER> Peter Kuepfer </PER> , who represents the family on the <ORG> Metro supervisory board </ORG> . 

( Additional reporting by <PER> Jonathan Gould </PER> ; 

<MISC> Yemeni </MISC> officials rowed back from President <PER> Ali Abdullah Saleh </PER> ¡¯s statement that he would step down within ¡° the coming days ¡± , and opponents dismissed the offer on Sunday as yet another delaying tactic to try and stay in power . 

<PER> Saleh </PER> , 69 , has defied protests all year against his three - decade rule , reversing repeated pledges to quit . 

The <LOC> United States </LOC> and <LOC> Saudi Arabia </LOC> worry that unrest risks tipping the dirt - poor nation into civil war and economic collapse . 

In a speech late on Saturday , <PER> Saleh </PER> said : ¡° I reject power and I will continue to reject it , and I will be leaving power in the coming days . 

But Deputy Information Minister <PER> Abdu al </PER> - <PER> Janadi </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> Saleh ¡¯s departure still depends on reaching an agreement , which had yet to be signed . 

He said this to show his commitment to this plan , but there is no plan for a resignation or transfer of powers before we have agreed and signed a deal . 

That would just plunge the country into chaos or even war , ¡± he said . 

He is ready to leave power in days , yes , but whether this happens in the coming days or months will depend on the success of negotiations for a deal . 

Protests against <PER> Saleh </PER> ¡¯s rule have paralyzed <LOC> Yemen </LOC> , weakening government control over swathes of the country and fanning fears al Qaeda ¡¯s regional wing may use the upheaval to expand its foothold near Red Sea oil - shipping routes . 

<PER> Saleh </PER> ¡¯s speech may be intended to deflect criticism in the <ORG> U.N. Security Council </ORG> , which is due to be briefed on <LOC> Yemen </LOC> in coming days and could consider a resolution calling on <PER> Saleh </PER> to implement a power transfer deal . 

¡° <PER> Saleh </PER> is a liar , nothing has changed since his speech , ¡± said <PER> Mohammed al </PER> - <ORG> Asl </ORG> , an organizer of protests by opponents of <PER> Saleh </PER> camped out in a central square in the capital <LOC> Sanaa </LOC> . 

¡° We ¡¯re used to this type of thing now . 

He just says anything to fool his own people , the world , and everyone . 

We ¡¯re not paying any attention to this . ¡± 

Protesters , camped out in tents in the area in <LOC> Sanaa </LOC> now dubbed ¡° Change Square ¡± , were going about their usual business of buying food , cooking and chewing wads of qat , a mild leaf stimulant that is common in <LOC> Yemen </LOC> . 

<PER> Saleh </PER> ¡¯s foreign minister met the ambassador for talks on Sunday , part of what many expect to be a diplomatic push to deflect action by the <ORG> Security Council </ORG> . 

New pressure has come from an unexpected quarter after the <MISC> Nobel Peace Prize </MISC> was awarded on Friday to <PER> Tawakul Karman </PER> , one of the leading activists who has been on the street at ¡° Change Square ¡± outside <LOC> Sanaa </LOC> University since February . 

The recognition of a <MISC> Yemeni </MISC> democracy activist could refocus global attention on the conflict in <LOC> Yemen </LOC> , a state of 23 million people with declining water resources , an imploding economy , separatist and sectarian conflicts and a surging al Qaeda wing . 

The wily leader , who came to power in 1978 , is under pressure from international allies , street protesters , armed opponents and opposition parties to make good on promises to hand over power . 

<LOC> Washington </LOC> and <LOC> Riyadh </LOC> fear <LOC> Yemen </LOC> could become a failed state overrun by <MISC> al </MISC> Qaeda . 

<PER> Saleh </PER> has given confusing signals about his intentions since January when protesters first took to the streets to demand reform and end his family ¡¯s authoritarian grip . 

He has already pulled back three times from signing a <MISC> Gulf Arab </MISC> peace initiative that would have seen him form an opposition - led cabinet and then hand power to his deputy before early parliamentary and presidential elections . 

He left the country for convalescence in <LOC> Riyadh </LOC> after surviving an assassination attempt in June , but flew back unannounced in late September . 

Diplomats have said they are close to getting international consensus on a Security Council resolution , which could come as early as this week , that would call on the government to implement the <LOC> Gulf </LOC> power transfer plan , which has <LOC> U.S. </LOC> backing . 

A <ORG> U.N. </ORG> envoy , <PER> Jamal Beomar </PER> , left <LOC> Yemen </LOC> to brief the council last week after a fruitless two weeks trying to mediate between <PER> Saleh </PER> ¡¯s government and the opposition . 

On Sunday , <LOC> U.S. </LOC> Ambassador <PER> Gerald Feierstein </PER> met <MISC> Yemeni </MISC> Foreign Minister <PER> Abubakr Abdullah Al </PER> - <PER> Qirbi </PER> and discussed the power transfer plan , <LOC> Yemen </LOC> ¡¯s official news agency <ORG> SABA </ORG> reported . 

This is all an effort to calm the international community before the briefing before the <ORG> Security Council </ORG> , ¡± said <ORG> Asl </ORG> , the protest organizer . 

In Saturday ¡¯s speech , <PER> Saleh </PER> repeated his condition that he would not cede power to long - time rivals from the opposition parties , who he says have hijacked the youth activists¡¯ protests and aim to subvert the constitutional process . 

<PER> Saleh </PER> ¡¯s presidential term ends in 2013 and he has said he will not run again , but analysts suspect he would like to outlast the crisis until then . 

The state of his health is not clear , though , after he was badly burned in the June attack . 

This is new propaganda from <PER> Saleh </PER> before <LOC> Yemen </LOC> is discussed at the <ORG> Security Council </ORG> , ¡± said <PER> Mohammed al </PER> - <PER> Sabri </PER> , an opposition coalition spokesman . 

Four months have passed since he said he accepted the <LOC> Gulf </LOC> transition deal , so what is stopping him ? 

He does n¡¯t even need a few days to do it . ¡± 

It sounds like the same lie , the same speech , over and over again , ¡± said student protester <PER> Fayza al </PER> - <PER> Suleimani </PER> . 

He wants to relieve pressure from the <ORG> U.N. </ORG> and quiet all the attention that was raised by <PER> Tawakul Karman </PER> ¡¯s <MISC> Nobel Peace Prize </MISC> . 

Even as <LOC> Washington </LOC> has urged <PER> Saleh </PER> to accept the power transfer deal , it has relied on <LOC> Yemen </LOC> ¡¯s cooperation in its covert war on militants based there . 

A CIA drone killed <MISC> American </MISC> - <MISC> Yemeni </MISC> cleric <PER> Anwar al </PER> - <PER> Awlaki </PER> in <LOC> Yemen </LOC> last month in what was seen as a major coup for <LOC> U.S. </LOC> President Barack Obama in the battle against <ORG> al Qaeda </ORG> .

Various courts are handling legal challenges to <LOC> Germany </LOC> ¡¯s hasty nuclear exit and some have already expressed doubts about the government ¡¯s position . 

The <MISC> German </MISC> Finance Ministry plans to appeal a ruling by a <LOC> Hamburg </LOC> court granting a temporary injunction on the payment of the tax , the ministry said last month . 

<LOC> Berlin </LOC> had hoped the tax would raise around 1.3 billion euros annually from nuclear power operators <ORG> RWE </ORG> , <ORG> E.ON </ORG> , <ORG> EnBW </ORG> and <ORG> Vattenfall </ORG> . 

The dispute encompasses a tax on nuclear fuel rods <ORG> RWE </ORG> says should not be levied on closed units , damages from a forced exit from a number of power stations and a constitutional court move to decide if the nuclear exit interfered with property rights .

<LOC> FRANKFURT </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <ORG> Henkel </ORG> , the <MISC> German </MISC> maker of <ORG> Persil detergent </ORG> and <ORG> Pritt </ORG> stick glue , is mulling acquisitions and is sticking to its goals , its chief executive told a <MISC> German </MISC> newspaper . 

If a target is available , brings us forward strategically and the price is right , we would certainly seize the opportunity , ¡± <PER> Kasper Rorsted </PER> told <ORG> Sueddeutsche Zeitung </ORG> newspaper in an interview released ahead of publication on Monday . 

<PER> Henkel </PER> was capable of paying for acquisitions out of its own pocket , <PER> Rorsted </PER> said . 

We have a very solid balance sheet structure and a strong cash flow , ¡± he told the paper . 

The group expects 2011 sales to rise about 5 percent . 

It is targeting an adjusted EBIT margin of around 13 percent in 2011 and 14 percent for 2012 . 

¡° We are sticking to our 14 percent target yield and there is no reason up to now why we should n¡¯t reach it , ¡± <PER> Rorsted </PER> said . 

I also think it is dangerous to be continuously correcting targets . 

The current economic situation is different from the global recession seen in 2008 , <PER> Rorsted </PER> said . 

¡° The chance of a repeat is extremely small , ¡± he said .

* Annual 7.31 pct inflation to Sept beyond cenbank target 

* <PER> Tombini </PER> previously said inflation to slow in Sept 

* Sept IPCA inflation rose 0.53 pct vs 0.37 pct in Aug 

<PER> SAO PAULO </PER> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Brazil </LOC> ¡¯s inflation will begin to slow in October , <ORG> central bank </ORG> chief <PER> Alexandre Tombini </PER> told a newspaper two days after official data disproved his previous forecast that rising prices would start slowing last month . 

Annualized inflation was 7.31 percent in September , a new six - year high and well above the <ORG> central bank </ORG> ¡¯s upper limit of 6.5 percent , the government ¡¯s <MISC> IPCA </MISC> index showed on Friday . 

Prices rose 0.53 percent in September from August due to a sharp rise in fuel prices . 

<PER> Tombini </PER> had been saying a few months ago he expected inflation would peak in August . 

Economists are concerned that his dovish expectations may be premature . 

In no way ( will prices continue to accelerate ) , ¡± <PER> Tombini </PER> told the <ORG> Folha de S.Paulo </ORG> newspaper published on Sunday . 

Our horizon is December 2012 but in October 12-month inflation will begin to fall by 0.30 percentage points . ¡± 

The central bank expects to meet its 4.5 percent inflation target by December of 2012 , <PER> Tombini </PER> said . 

It has a 2-point margin on either side of the target . 

Market expectations monitored by the central bank see inflation at 6.52 percent at the end of 2011 , slightly above the upper limit of 6.5 percent . 

¡° Of those countries that have inflation targets , various economies have inflation above the band or target , ¡± <PER> Tombini </PER> said . 

After the <MISC> Brazilian </MISC> economy grew by 7.5 percent last year , the <ORG> central bank </ORG> raised its benchmark Selic interest rate consistently from the start of this year to 12.5 percent . 

But in August , the bank surprised markets in the current inflationary climate with its decision to cut the Selic rate by 50 basis points to 12 percent . 

The bank said the effects of the <MISC> European </MISC> debt crisis and a fragile <LOC> U.S. </LOC> economy would have a chilling effect on local demand . 

¡° Since the start of the year , our flight plan ... was to moderate the growth of the <MISC> Brazilian </MISC> economy , ¡± <PER> Tombini </PER> said . 

¡° There were signs , clearer every day , that this slowdown was happening . 

We also said that monetary policy would have a delayed effect and that in the second half of the year these policies would be more strongly felt . 

<PER> Tombini </PER> said the <ORG> central bank ¡¯s daily </ORG> soundings were showing month - to - month inflation would come in at around 0.30 to 0.40 percent in October , well below the 0.75 percent on October 2010 and below this September . 

This slowing trend would also hold through the end of the year , <PER> Tombini </PER> said .

<ORG> MILWAUKEE </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - The <ORG> Presbyterian Church </ORG> ( <LOC> USA </LOC> ) ordained its first openly gay minister on Saturday in <LOC> Madison </LOC> , <LOC> Wisconsin </LOC> , three months after lifting its long - standing ban on homosexual clergy . 

<PER> Scott Anderson </PER> , 56 , was ordained minister at the <LOC> Covenant Presbyterian Church </LOC> in front of a jubilant congregation . 

It was a big day for me and also for the Presbyterian Church , ¡± <PER> Anderson </PER> said in a telephone interview . 

¡° It was very healing for me and for many people there . 

Presbyterians do n¡¯t cheer very often , but there was some cheering , ¡± <PER> Anderson </PER> said . 

<PER> Anderson </PER> , who years ago had been rejected by members of his congregation at the <LOC> Bethany Presbyterian </LOC> Church in <LOC> Sacramento </LOC> , <LOC> California </LOC> , left the ministry in 1990 . 

He has been with his partner , <PER> Ian MacAllister </PER> , for 20 years . 

¡° I never thought the day would come in my life time when the Presbyterian Church would change its mind about ordaining gays and lesbians , ¡± he said . 

Since leaving the ministry , <PER> Anderson </PER> had remained active in the church . 

He began the process of returning to the ministry five years ago . 

The Presbyterian Church in July changed its constitution to allow openly gay and lesbian ministers . 

It just so happened that I was the first in line , I did n¡¯t intend to be the first , ¡± <PER> Anderson </PER> said . 

¡° What a great privilege and honor and humbling to be the first . 

<PER> Anderson </PER> said he believes his ordination reflects a cultural shift throughout organized religion and public policy in the <LOC> United States </LOC> . 

¡° Institutional religion has not always been a helpful conversation partner with the wider culture and my hope and prayer is that , with this action of the Presbyterian Church , we will increasingly become a more constructive player in the wider cultural discussion about gays and lesbians , ¡± he said .

After his appointment as chief executive of <ORG> Dexia SA </ORG> in 2008 , <PER> Pierre Mariani </PER> took the first train from <LOC> Paris </LOC> to <LOC> Brussels </LOC> . 

He arrived to find his predecessor <PER> Axel Miller </PER> still packing his belongings . 

<PER> Miller </PER> told him that , despite a 6 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> ( $ 8.1 billion ) state - led bailout , the bank was on the verge of collapse . 

Rival banks did not wish to lend it any more money . 

Three years later , <PER> Mariani </PER> is presiding over the first bank to fall victim to the <MISC> European </MISC> sovereign debt crisis . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> is near collapse and being forced to rely on <MISC> French </MISC> and <MISC> Belgian </MISC> state support . 

A plan due to be announced Sunday was likely to call for the break - up of the group into several units , including a ¡° bad bank ¡± to handle nonperforming 

assets . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> has been criticized for not acting fast enough to stave of disaster , but so far is not seen as the main culprit . 

Mr. <PER> Mariani </PER> is a firefighter , ¡± said <PER> Michel De Herde </PER> , budget chief of the <LOC> Brussels </LOC> district of <LOC> Schaerbeek </LOC> , a <ORG> Dexia </ORG> shareholder . 

He fought hard but he did n¡¯t manage to put out the flames . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> was born in the <MISC> Moroccan </MISC> capital <LOC> Rabat </LOC> in 1957 , about a year after <LOC> Morocco </LOC> gained independence from <LOC> France </LOC> . 

The son of a schoolteacher and a police officer , he grew up in the southern <MISC> French </MISC> port of <LOC> Marseille </LOC> , attending two of the <LOC> Mediterranean city </LOC> ¡¯s best high schools . 

He then followed the elite path of <LOC> France </LOC> ¡¯s top businessmen and public servants : the <ORG> HEC </ORG> business school in <LOC> Paris </LOC> , and the <ORG> ¨¦cole Nationale d¡¯Administration </ORG> , the top training school for the nation ¡¯s leaders . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> joined the ministry of finance in 1982 and in 1993 he agreed to head up the office of the new budget minister , a young politician called <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> joined <ORG> BNP Paribas </ORG> in 1997 and subsequently became responsible for overseas retail banking . 

One of his coups was <ORG> BNP </ORG> Paribas¡¯ 2006 acquisition of <MISC> Italian </MISC> bank <ORG> BNL </ORG> . 

What could be more exciting for me than to put a company like <ORG> Dexia </ORG> back on its feet ¡ª with its wealth of talent and skills ¡ª and give it a future again 

, ¡± <PER> Mariani </PER> told <MISC> French </MISC> daily <ORG> Le Figaro </ORG> at the time . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> had become the <ORG> world ¡¯s largest finance </ORG> provider to the public sector after its 2000 purchase of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> bond <ORG> insurer Financial Security Assurance </ORG> ( <ORG> FSA </ORG> ) . 

This business yielded bumper profits before the 2008 financial crisis . 

But <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s key problem was a mismatch between the terms of its borrowing and lending . 

Its business of financing municipalities and other public authorities meant making long - term loans . 

To finance this , <ORG> Dexia </ORG> relied on short - term borrowing . 

In the early and mid 2000s , the group profited from the difference between lower short - term interest rates and higher longer - term rates . 

But when the short - term money dried up , the model collapsed . 

To make matters worse , <ORG> Dexia </ORG> has 4.8 billion euros of exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> , among the highest for a non - <MISC> Greek </MISC> lender . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> was the heaviest user of the Federal Reserve ¡¯s ¡° discount window ¡± loans and soaked up 11 percent of the <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> ¡¯s refinancing during the crisis at the end of 2008 . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> drew as much as $ 37 billion of Fed ¡® discount window¡¯ loans , more than any other institution and was also the heaviest borrower under the scheme when Fed lending to banks peaked at the end of October 2008 . 

Since starting his job , <PER> Mariani </PER> has put in place a 600 million <MISC> euro </MISC> cost - saving plan , sold its <LOC> U.S. </LOC> monoline insurance business and exited other markets and cut its short - term funding by more than half . 

Critics say the <ORG> Dexia </ORG> chief was too slow to transform the bank . 

He could have earned the group a valuable lifeline by selling <MISC> Turkish </MISC> unit , Denizbank , but <PER> Mariani </PER> believed <LOC> Turkey </LOC> would become the profit engine of a resurgent <ORG> Dexia </ORG> in coming years . 

Some say an authoritarian style resulted in the departure of executives , notably <MISC> Belgian </MISC> banking chief <PER> Stefaan Decraene </PER> who left last month . 

However , the challenge of saving <ORG> Dexia </ORG> might have been too great for anyone , and speeding up asset sales could have weakened the bank ¡¯s businesses . 

Concerning the management , I would like to note that what happened to <ORG> Dexia </ORG> was based on a business model which was decided on in the mid 1990s , ¡± <MISC> Belgian </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Yves Leterme </PER> said on television Sunday evening . 

It turned out that this model was n¡¯t right and that the situation got worse because of the sovereign debt crisis all over the world , especially in <LOC> Greece </LOC> . ¡±

Mr. <PER> Mariani </PER> is a firefighter , ¡± said <PER> Michel De Herde </PER> , budget chief of the <LOC> Brussels </LOC> district of <LOC> Schaerbeek </LOC> , a <ORG> Dexia </ORG> shareholder . 

He fought hard but he did n¡¯t manage to put out the flames . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> was born in the <MISC> Moroccan </MISC> capital <LOC> Rabat </LOC> in 1957 , about a year after <LOC> Morocco </LOC> gained independence from <LOC> France </LOC> . 

The son of a schoolteacher and a police officer , he grew up in the southern <MISC> French </MISC> port of <LOC> Marseille </LOC> , attending two of the <LOC> Mediterranean city </LOC> ¡¯s best high schools . 

He then followed the elite path of <LOC> France </LOC> ¡¯s top businessmen and public servants : the <ORG> HEC </ORG> business school in <LOC> Paris </LOC> , and the <ORG> ¨¦cole Nationale d¡¯Administration </ORG> , the top training school for the nation ¡¯s leaders . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> joined the ministry of finance in 1982 and in 1993 he agreed to head up the office of the new budget minister , a young politician called <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> . 

<PER> Mariani </PER> joined <ORG> BNP Paribas </ORG> in 1997 and subsequently became responsible for overseas retail banking . 

One of his coups was <ORG> BNP </ORG> Paribas¡¯ 2006 acquisition of <MISC> Italian </MISC> bank <ORG> BNL </ORG> . 

What could be more exciting for me than to put a company like <ORG> Dexia </ORG> back on its feet ¡ª with its wealth of talent and skills ¡ª and give it a future again 

, ¡± <PER> Mariani </PER> told <MISC> French </MISC> daily <ORG> Le Figaro </ORG> at the time . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> had become the <ORG> world ¡¯s largest finance </ORG> provider to the public sector after its 2000 purchase of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> bond <ORG> insurer Financial Security Assurance </ORG> ( <ORG> FSA </ORG> ) . 

This business yielded bumper profits before the 2008 financial crisis . 

But <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s key problem was a mismatch between the terms of its borrowing and lending . 

Its business of financing municipalities and other public authorities meant making long - term loans . 

To finance this , <ORG> Dexia </ORG> relied on short - term borrowing . 

In the early and mid 2000s , the group profited from the difference between lower short - term interest rates and higher longer - term rates . 

But when the short - term money dried up , the model collapsed . 

To make matters worse , <ORG> Dexia </ORG> has 4.8 billion euros of exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> , among the highest for a non - <MISC> Greek </MISC> lender . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> was the heaviest user of the Federal Reserve ¡¯s ¡° discount window ¡± loans and soaked up 11 percent of the <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> ¡¯s refinancing during the crisis at the end of 2008 . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> drew as much as $ 37 billion of Fed ¡® discount window¡¯ loans , more than any other institution and was also the heaviest borrower under the scheme when Fed lending to banks peaked at the end of October 2008 . 

Since starting his job , <PER> Mariani </PER> has put in place a 600 million <MISC> euro </MISC> cost - saving plan , sold its <LOC> U.S. </LOC> monoline insurance business and exited other markets and cut its short - term funding by more than half . 

Critics say the <ORG> Dexia </ORG> chief was too slow to transform the bank . 

He could have earned the group a valuable lifeline by selling <MISC> Turkish </MISC> unit , Denizbank , but <PER> Mariani </PER> believed <LOC> Turkey </LOC> would become the profit engine of a resurgent <ORG> Dexia </ORG> in coming years . 

Some say an authoritarian style resulted in the departure of executives , notably <MISC> Belgian </MISC> banking chief <PER> Stefaan Decraene </PER> who left last month . 

However , the challenge of saving <ORG> Dexia </ORG> might have been too great for anyone , and speeding up asset sales could have weakened the bank ¡¯s businesses . 

Concerning the management , I would like to note that what happened to <ORG> Dexia </ORG> was based on a business model which was decided on in the mid 1990s , ¡± <MISC> Belgian </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Yves Leterme </PER> said on television Sunday evening . 

It turned out that this model was n¡¯t right and that the situation got worse because of the sovereign debt crisis all over the world , especially in <LOC> Greece </LOC> . ¡±

( Archibishop of <PER> Canterbury Rowan Williams </PER> at a church service in the capital <LOC> Harare </LOC> , October 9 , 2011/Philimon <LOC> Bulawayo </LOC> ) 

The Archbishop of Canterbury <PER> Rowan Williams </PER> on Sunday issued a strong criticism of the government of <PER> Robert Mugabe </PER> and told thousands of cheering Anglican members in <LOC> Harare </LOC> not to retaliate against attacks on the church in <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> . 

<PER> Williams¡¯ </PER> comments risk angering the <MISC> Zimbabwean </MISC> president who has not yet confirmed whether he would meet the Anglican archbishop , on a rare visit to <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> . 

<PER> Williams </PER> , who travelled with police escort , was greeted by thousands of singing and cheering Anglican members at an indoor sports centre in <LOC> Harare </LOC> where he delivered a sermon attended by bishops from <LOC> South Africa </LOC> , <LOC> Zambia </LOC> , <LOC> Bostwana </LOC> and <LOC> Tanzania </LOC> . 

¡° For a long period in this country , an anxious ruling class clung on to the power they had seized at the expense of the indigenous people and ignored their rights and their hopes for dignity and political freedom ¡­ 

How tragic that this should be replaced by another kind of lawlessness , where so many live in daily fear of attack if they fail to comply with what the powerful require of them , ¡± <PER> Williams </PER> told the crowd . 

He said people in <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> had been victims of greed and violence . 

In this community , there can be no place for violence or for retaliation ¡± . 

The Anglican Church is appealing against an Aug. 4 ruling that gave rebel bishop <PER> Nolbert Kunonga </PER> , a Mugabe supporter who leads a breakaway faction of the church , custody of the church ¡¯s <MISC> Zimbabwean </MISC> properties .

A bomb exploded outside a church in <LOC> Maiduguri </LOC> in northeast <LOC> Nigeria </LOC> on Sunday , reviving concerns about a radical <MISC> Islamist </MISC> sect in the remote region of <LOC> Africa </LOC> ¡¯s most populous nation . 

No one was confirmed dead but hospital staff said they had treated some wounded , including one soldier . 

The bomb was planted near a church where our boys were on guard but fortunately no casualties were recorded , ¡± the operations officer for a joint military task force said . 

He did not confirm whether the blast was carried out by <PER> Boko Haram </PER> , a sect whose name means ¡° Western education is forbidden ¡± and which has been behind almost daily shootings or attacks with homemade explosives in recent months . 

The sect ¡¯s ambition has grown and <MISC> Nigerian </MISC> and foreign officials have said the group has strengthening links with <MISC> al Qaeda ¡¯s north African </MISC> wing . 

<PER> Boko Haram </PER> took responsibility for <LOC> Nigeria </LOC> ¡¯s first successful suicide attack in August , when the driver rammed a car full of explosives into the side of <ORG> U.N. </ORG> headquarters in the capital <LOC> Abuja </LOC> , killing 23 people . 

Since the <ORG> U.N. </ORG> blast security has been increased in all major towns and cities and scores of suspected members of <MISC> Boko </MISC> <LOC> Haram </LOC> have been arrested , some facing trial this month for their part in deadly bombings . 

The crackdown reduced the number of attacks in the sect ¡¯s home base in the dusty northeast but at least two people were killed in a gunfight last week and Sunday ¡¯s blast was a reminder of the threat still posed by bombers . 

¡° We thought peace has come to stay and there wo n¡¯t be any more bombs . 

I am getting my family out of this place tomorrow , I ¡¯ve had enough of <LOC> Maiduguri </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Okechukwu </PER> , a pharmacy owner said .

Anger over the loss of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> jobs , fear that <LOC> America </LOC> ¡¯s global economic dominance is sliding , and bitter presidential politics have created a toxic backdrop for <LOC> U.S. </LOC> lawmakers this week as they vote on three free - trade deals and a currency bill aimed at penalizing <LOC> China </LOC> . 

The decisions in <ORG> Congress </ORG> will prove an important litmus test for <LOC> United </LOC> States¡¯ willingness to embrace trade - opening measures in the face of high unemployment and a stalling economic recovery . 

The <LOC> China </LOC> currency bill , due for a vote in the <ORG> U.S. Senate </ORG> on Tuesday , is the most telling measure and has gained increasing levels of support . 

It would require the Obama administration to <PER> levy </PER> tariffs on <LOC> China </LOC> and four other <MISC> Asian </MISC> countries for depressing the value of their currencies in an effort to boost their exports . 

Trade data due to be released on Thursday could sharpen the debate even further . 

The <LOC> U.S. </LOC> trade deficit is forecast to have worsened to $ 46 billion in August from $ 44.81 billion . 

<LOC> China </LOC> also reports trade data for September . 

Its exports are forecast to have risen a robust 20 percent from a year earlier , though down from August ¡¯s 24.5 percent growth . 

For some <LOC> U.S. </LOC> lawmakers facing reelection in 13 months , delivering a trade bill that penalizes <LOC> China </LOC> for using its yuan currency to gain export share would arm them with an answer to voters questioning how they are addressing the highest <LOC> U.S. </LOC> unemployment in a quarter of century . 

The unemployment rate remains stuck at 9.1 percent for a third straight month . 

<LOC> House </LOC> <MISC> Republicans </MISC> and <MISC> Democrats </MISC> have signed onto a similar bill , and they have sufficient support to override <LOC> U.S. </LOC> House Speaker <PER> John Boehner </PER> and bring it to a vote . 

<PER> Boehner </PER> like the <LOC> White House </LOC> has warned that the bill is ¡° pretty dangerous ¡± and could lead to a trade war with <LOC> China </LOC> . 

While that final showdown on the <LOC> China </LOC> currency bill is not expected this week , debate over jobs will intensify as long - stalled Free Trade Agreements with <LOC> South Korea </LOC> , <LOC> Colombia </LOC> and <LOC> Panama </LOC> come up for votes on Tuesday and Wednesday . 

Each side is issuing a barrage of contradictory estimates of job losses , job creation and growth destruction . 

Disentangling the precise impact of free trade is very difficult , given the complex dynamics of <ORG> inter </ORG> - linked global economies where job loss in one area leads to growth in other sectors . 

<PER> Uri Dadush </PER> , director of international economics at the <ORG> Carnegie Endowment for International Peace </ORG> and a former director of trade at the <ORG> World Bank </ORG> , said any quantitative estimates on jobs or growth are tentative at best . 

More important in the trade votes , he said , will be the political signaling from the world ¡¯s dominant power when the global economy is extremely vulnerable . 

The <LOC> U.S. </LOC> is still the largest economy by a wide margin and it is still setting the tone on international economic relations . 

<LOC> China </LOC> is the second largest economy . 

Deterioration in trade relations between the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> and <LOC> China </LOC> is only going to hurt us at a very serious time , when <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s debt crisis could spin out of control , ¡± he said . 

Of the three Free Trade Agreement deals , the one with <LOC> South Korea </LOC> appears to have the strongest chance of passage . 

It would prove a welcome gesture for <LOC> South Korea </LOC> President <PER> Lee Myung </PER> - <PER> Bak </PER> ¡¯s state visit to the <LOC> United States </LOC> on Thursday . 

The <ORG> International Trade Commission </ORG> , a <LOC> U.S. </LOC> government agency , estimates that the <LOC> South Korea </LOC> pact could generate anywhere from zero to 280,000 new <LOC> U.S. </LOC> jobs . 

The <ORG> U.S. Chamber of Commerce </ORG> says it would restore <LOC> U.S. </LOC> market share lost to the <ORG> European Union </ORG> , which already has reduced <LOC> South Korea </LOC> tariffs . 

The <LOC> Colombia </LOC> free trade deal faces hurdles over concerns about the treatment of union workers by <LOC> Latin America </LOC> ¡¯s fourth largest economy , though most observers expects it will be approved along with a smaller one from <LOC> Panama </LOC> . 

<PER> Robert Scott </PER> , a trade economist at the <ORG> liberal Economic Policy Institute </ORG> , is more skeptical on passage of all three . 

¡° People have a growing awareness that the trade system is not working and these deals are job killers , ¡± he said . 

He has estimated that the <LOC> South Korea </LOC> and <LOC> Colombia </LOC> deals would destroy 214,000 jobs in the seven years after their implementation . 

Estimates of job creation only look at the export side of the equation and omit the impact of import substitution and foreign direct investment that leads to outsourcing , he said . 

For those watching the vulnerability of global growth , look for <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s industrial production on Tuesday , which is forecast to have fallen by 0.2 percent in September for the second month . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> retail sales for September on Friday also will be an important barometer . 

They are forecast to have risen 0.6 percent after a flat reading in August . 

In <LOC> China </LOC> , growth has been slowing and that may deliver <LOC> Beijing </LOC> a welcome respite from inflation . 

The consumer price index on Friday is expected to ease slightly to 6.0 percent from 6.2 percent in August . 

That would still be well above <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s annual target of 4 percent , but it would mark a second consecutive month of declines from a peak of 6.5 percent notched in July .

* Studies find correlation between rising fees , problems 

* Investors should pay more attention , say researchers 

Elevated audit fees can be a red flag of problems to come for a company , say three recent academic studies that together warn about increased chances of fraud , stock price declines or financial restatements . 

Companies have been disclosing how much they pay their auditors since 2001 , when the <ORG> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission </ORG> instituted the requirement as part of a push to improve corporate auditor independence . 

The numbers may be underappreciated by investors , however , who seem not to recognize the special insights auditors have . 

The auditors have private information about the firm because of their interaction with management . 

They obviously have a lot of risk associated with any fraud at a firm , and we assume they adjust their fee accordingly , ¡± said <PER> Ryan Wilson </PER> , who teaches accounting at the <ORG> Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa </ORG> , in an interview October 5 . 

He co - authored an April 2010 study on the topic . 

A high or rising audit fee can indicate one of two things , experts say . 

Either the auditor is charging a risk premium , aiming to cover future legal costs to them of something going awry , or they may just be doing more work on the audit , digging into areas where results are uncertain . 

The studies¡¯ findings come at a moment when regulators are considering requiring auditors to give out even more information . 

A proposal under consideration by the <ORG> U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board </ORG> might have auditors disclosing more than the current minimal thumbs up or down . 

Meantime , their fees seem to be telling a valuable story . 

Audit fees substantially above those paid by competitors and companies of similar size are strongly associated with a slip in operating performance the following year , and to a lesser degree as many as five years later , according to research by <PER> Jonathan Stanley </PER> , an accounting professor at <ORG> Auburn University </ORG> , published in the current August / October issue of Auditing , a journal of the <ORG> American Accounting Association </ORG> . 

In addition to forecasting operating declines , high audit fees are predictive of fraud and restatements , and rising fees can foreshadow steep stock price drops , credit rating downgrades and class action lawsuits , the research has found . 

<ORG> American International Group Inc </ORG> , the insurance giant bailed out by the government on the brink of bankruptcy in 2008 , is one of a number of examples cited in interviews with the authors of the studies . 

According to <ORG> SEC </ORG> filings , AIG paid $ 66 million for its 2004 audit , a $ 33 million increase over its 2003 fee . 

In 2005 , the company restated its 2000 , 2001 , 2002 and 2003 numbers . 

Another example is <MISC> Swedish </MISC> mobile phone maker <ORG> Ericsson </ORG> . 

<PER> Nicole Thorne </PER> Jenkins of <ORG> Vanderbilt University ¡¯s Owen Graduate School of Management </ORG> said the fees climbed significantly faster than peers¡¯ the year before it issued a 36 percent profit decline in 2007 that sent its stock down sharply . 

A 2004 sales shortfall at technology group <ORG> Altera Corp </ORG> was preceded by a rise in its audit fee . 

<ORG> PricewaterhouseCoopers </ORG> , the auditor of all three companies , declined to comment citing a policy of not discussing client matters . 

<PER> Jenkins </PER> said in an October 5 interview that her research published April 2011 found investors as a group do not recognize the importance of audit fees . 

<ORG> Auburn ¡¯s Stanley </ORG> said investors should consider audit fees with other metrics like short interest and analysts¡¯ forecasts , in an October 5 interview . 

There ¡¯s a link between audit price and future performance , ¡± he said . 

Unusually low fees may be worth keeping an eye on too , argued <PER> Donald Whalen </PER> , director of research for <ORG> Audit Analytics </ORG> , in an October 6 interview . 

If audit fees are way down , how can the auditor be performing the necessary work ? 

<PER> Whalen </PER> highlighted the case of government - backed loan purchaser <ORG> Fannie Mae </ORG> . 

<ORG> Auditor KPMG </ORG> charged the lender less than $ 3 million a year in 2001 , 2002 and 2003 . 

When the company changed auditors in 2004 , hiring <ORG> Deloitte & Touche </ORG> , the fees went up sharply to a dramatic $ 203 million in 2004 . 

Fees have since dropped , but at $ 37 million for the 2010 audit , they remain well above KPMG ¡¯s price . 

<ORG> Fannie Mae ¡¯s regulator </ORG> , the <ORG> Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight </ORG> , raised questions about the company ¡¯s accounting in 2004 , after which its stock dropped sharply . 

The company eventually restated 2001 - 2004 earnings , erasing $ 6.3 billion of reported income . 

<LOC> WARSAW </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> , the head of <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s main opposition party , said on Sunday he was conceding defeat in the general election after exit polls showed it nearly 10 percentage points behind the ruling Civic Platform . 

A significant part of society has decided that the way things are right now is fine , ¡± <PER> Kaczynski </PER> said in a concession speech . 

We respect the result of the election . 

The leader of <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s small <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> said it was ready to join a new coalition government headed by Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> ¡¯s centre - right Civic Platform after Sunday ¡¯s parliamentary election . 

A coalition with Civic Platform is possible but we have to give it careful thought , ¡± <PER> Waldemar Pawlak </PER> said on television after an exit poll showed <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s party far ahead of rivals with nearly 40 percent of the vote and the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> with 8.2 percent . 

The two parties have been in a coalition government since 2007 , steering <LOC> Poland </LOC> smoothly through a global financial crisis without going into recession .

<PER> Pope Benedict </PER> on Sunday condemned ¡° ferocious ¡± organised crime groups in the southern <LOC> Calabria </LOC> region , where lawlessness , corruption and underdevelopment have resulted in one of <LOC> Italy </LOC> ¡¯s highest unemployment rates . 

The pope , in a homily for tens of thousands of people from all over the region that forms the ¡° toe ¡± of <LOC> Italy </LOC> , said the area seemed to be in a constant state of emergency and that he wanted to encourage the people ¡¯s efforts to improve their condition . 

where problems exist in acute and destabilising forms , where crime groups that are often ferocious tear at the social fabric , a land that seems to be in a constant state of emergency , ¡± he said . 

<LOC> Calabria </LOC> is home to the <ORG> ¡® Ndrangheta </ORG> , considered among the most dangerous and powerful crime syndicates in western <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

Investigators believe that the highly secretive <MISC> Calabrian </MISC> group has overtaken the <MISC> Sicilian </MISC> Mafia to dominate drug trafficking and extortion rackets in <LOC> Europe </LOC> and beyond . 

Unemployment in <LOC> Calabria </LOC> , one of the most backward regions in <LOC> Italy </LOC> despite its potential in industries such as tourism and shipping , is about 32 percent against a national rate of 7.9 percent . 

Youth unemployment peaks at about 50 percent in parts of the mostly mountainous and coastal region . 

<ORG> Lamezia </ORG> ¡¯s mayor , <PER> Gianni Speranza </PER> , who has received threats from the mob because of his anti - crime programme , speaking before the pope , called <LOC> Calabria </LOC> ¡° a land of suffering ¡­ of unacceptable unemployment , of dramatic injustices and violence .

<PER> Saviour Kasukuwere </PER> , <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> ¡¯s Indigenisation Minister , reportedly said . 

<LOC> MISRATA </LOC> , <LOC> Libya </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Months of bombardment by <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> ¡¯s forces , and a central role in the war that ended his rule , have bound the devastated <MISC> Libyan </MISC> city of <LOC> Misrata </LOC> into an extended military family that runs on trust . 

But as <LOC> Misrata </LOC> , a commercial hub whose notables opened their wallets to arm a volunteer force , flexes its muscle in the new world of <MISC> Libyan </MISC> politics in which gunmen speak as loudly as politicians , it is increasingly inclined to trust no one . 

A collective memory of suffering , already expressed as a grudge with the rest of <LOC> Libya </LOC> in the scramble for political power after <PER> Gaddafi </PER> , has also taken on a bitter edge at home . 

Even local patriots now wonder about the prospects for a peaceful political transition across the country , if hometown solidarity begins to fray . 

¡° <LOC> Misrata </LOC> belongs to those who stood up for us , not those who left when things got tough , ¡± reads a slogan spray - painted on walls across the city - and the military checkpoints surrounding it - in reference those who fled the shelling <LOC> Misrata </LOC> endured after it rose up against Gaddafi in February , and who now seek to return . 

The message , some argue , only reflects fear of the havoc a fifth column of <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s scattered loyalists might unleash if military vigilance lapses as <LOC> Misrata </LOC> , along with the rest of the country , struggles to resume a normal life . 

It ¡¯s just because the next city away is <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , 

¡± says one would - be returnee at a checkpoint outside <LOC> Misrata </LOC> , referring to <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s hometown some 140 km ( 87 miles ) distant , where <LOC> Misrata </LOC> fighters are attempting to crush one of the last pockets of pro - Gaddafi resistance with barrages of rockets and mortars . 

There has to be some kind of security procedure , because there is still a war , ¡± said that man , who declined to be identified as he waited for gunmen to let him drive toward <LOC> Misrata </LOC> , accompanied by a resident in better standing who would vouch for him . 

Those who would return need neighbours or members of a sufficiently respected military unit to testify to their bona fides , they say . 

¡° We ¡¯re only looking for people who acted against <LOC> Misrata </LOC> and its population , including people who committed kidnappings . 

They are at large , ¡± says <PER> Mohammed Abu Sneina </PER> , a commander with the city ¡¯s 

<LOC> Al </LOC> - Hariga militia , which mans one such checkpoint at <LOC> Dafniyah </LOC> , about 20 km outside <LOC> Misrata </LOC> . 

When it happens for routine cases , it ¡¯s temporary . 

That routine vigilance hints at strains in a network of good faith that the city ¡¯s people invoke , wherever the last stages of the war against Gaddafi brings them . 

At tanker trucks parked alongside the road linking <LOC> Misrata </LOC> to <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , gunmen returning from a day ¡¯s fighting fill their vehicles - often adorned with the makeshift rocket launchers that are the tools of their war , or loaded with objects , such as equipment from the recently conquered <LOC> Sirte </LOC> airport , that are its spoils . 

They register their license plate numbers in ledgers kept for the <LOC> Misrata </LOC> businessmen who send the fuel , and also fund the makeshift rest stops which ply commuting gunmen with tea , tuna sandwiches and packaged cakes . 

Closer to home , three words recur in Misratans¡¯ descriptions of themselves and their relations : ¡® tarabut¡¯ , or being connected to one another ; ¡® tadamon¡¯ , or solidarity ; and ¡® takaatuf¡¯ , or standing shoulder - to - shoulder . 

Departures from those ideals leave some in the city , where empty shell casings that mark its bombardment have pride of place in the <LOC> china </LOC> cabinets of affluent homes , wondering what form wartime unity will take now . 

A resident affiliated with one of the city ¡¯s most celebrated brigades recounts the experience of the child of a returned family ostracized by classmates when classes resumed at the local primary school . 

This is shameful , and it frightens me , because it will turn people against one another , ¡± said this on - again , off - again militiaman . 

¡° If <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> sees this , wherever he is , he must be laughing . 

The ominous shades in <LOC> Misrata </LOC> ¡¯s portrait of itself are visible in its Goushi district , once populated in part by black Libyans with roots in the city of <LOC> Tawargha </LOC> , which lies about 40 km south of <LOC> Misrata </LOC> . 

<PER> Tawargha </PER> provided a staging ground and some recruits for Gaddafi ¡¯s campaign to crush the uprising against him in <LOC> Misrata </LOC> . 

The city ¡¯s fighters recount a campaign of rape and other atrocities waged by volunteers from <LOC> Tawargha </LOC> , and circulate a <LOC> Misrata </LOC> battle plan purportedly seized from the headquarters of a paramilitary unit led by one of <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s sons that describes a role for irregulars from <LOC> Tawargha </LOC> . 

<LOC> Misrata </LOC> ¡¯s fighters sacked <PER> Tawargha </PER> in August . 

It is now partly in ruins and its former population displaced across <LOC> Libya </LOC> , including <LOC> Sirte </LOC> . 

Goushi itself appears emptier than much of the rest of <LOC> Misrata </LOC> , if less damaged by shells and rockets . 

<PER> Fawzi Moreiweis </PER> runs a local charity with offices in the district supporting local fighters maimed in the campaign against <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> . 

He echoes charges , leveled in the capital and elsewhere , that local authorities and the ruling <ORG> National Transitional Council </ORG> ( <ORG> NTC </ORG> ) have betrayed the wounded , and waste or misuse funds to intended treat them . 

<ORG> NTC </ORG> proposals to compensate the wounded with housing , and calls for reconciliation and self - control from fighters - apparently sparked by criticism of attacks on <MISC> Africans </MISC> and dark - skinned <MISC> Libyans </MISC> branded as <PER> Gaddafi </PER> ¡¯s mercenaries - inspire his scorn . 

¡° They say , do n¡¯t mistreat the mercenaries , these Nigerians . 

Well , you are standing before heroes , 

¡± he says , gesturing toward militiamen who are among the city ¡¯s growing ranks of amputees . 

¡° This money for housing should be given to the wounded directly , ¡± he says . 

One of those fighters , <PER> Mohammed Marzouq </PER> , calls the jockeying for shares in a transitional government , in which representation of <LOC> Misrata </LOC> is emerging as a stumbling block , an insult . 

¡° If it was n¡¯t for the people who paid the price with their limbs , this revolution would never have succeeded , ¡± he says . 

What right do they have to divide up seats ? 

If anyone tries to push <LOC> Misrata </LOC> aside , we will put him aside . 

Fighters from the city who set up shop in the capital since converging there with others from across <LOC> Libya </LOC> to assault Gaddafi ¡¯s compound in August agree . 

They , like <LOC> Misrata </LOC> ¡¯s fighters on the remaining front , roar laughter over a widely circulated recording that appears to catch a respected <LOC> Misrata </LOC> commander berating the <ORG> NTC </ORG> military spokesman , who works from a <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> hotel , over his absence in the field . 

And like fighters from other regions , notably the western town of <LOC> Zintan </LOC> , they dismiss the head of <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> ¡¯s military council , <PER> Abdulhakim Belhadj </PER> , who has called for military units from elsewhere to pull their weapons from the capital . 

Does he have the experience and the means to secure all the ministries , embassies , vital institutions ? 

¡± asked <PER> Adel al </PER> - <PER> Gallal </PER> , whose <ORG> Jaysh Misrata </ORG> brigade runs a checkpoint outside a landmark <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> shopping center . 

That ¡¯s why we ¡¯re here , ¡± he said , a day after fighters from <LOC> Zintan </LOC> marched on a position of <PER> Belhadj </PER> ¡¯s in the capital , before turning back . 

That incident came after non - <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> fighters distributed a derisive , mock - formal arrest warrant for <PER> Belhadj </PER> that resembled wanted posters for fugitive members of <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s regime . 

<PER> Abu Bakr Mohammed </PER> , who once built platforms for wedding ceremonies , has a twisted , raised scar from a shrapnel wound on his forehead to mark his experience of the siege of <LOC> Misrata </LOC> . 

He sees his presence in <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> and status as a soldier , as necessary , but ultimately worrisome . 

¡° I ¡¯ll go back as soon as things have settled down . 

I want a civil society , not an army existence , ¡± he says . 

I want to get married , and I was going to , in April , before all this started . 

¡° I ¡¯d never even seen a gun , let alone carried one around and shot it . 

I do n¡¯t know how long it ¡¯s good for everybody to be doing this . ¡± 

* US , <MISC> Canadian </MISC> , <MISC> German </MISC> ventures restarting in <LOC> east </LOC> 

* Largest <ORG> Ras Lanuf </ORG> refinery could resume processing in days 

* Many still reluctant to return due to security concerns 

Foreign companies are quietly returning to <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s oil fields east of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , deploying skeleton teams to an area of the hydrocarbon - rich basin near the <LOC> Jakhira oasis </LOC> , where almost a quarter of a million barrels of crude per day was pumped into pipelines bound for the coast before the war . 

<LOC> Germany </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Wintershall </ORG> is the latest firm to have sent a small group of <MISC> Libyan </MISC> workers to a cluster of oil fields , where sites jointly operated by <LOC> U.S. </LOC> firm <ORG> Occidental Petroleum Corp </ORG> and <LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s 

<ORG> Suncor Energy Inc </ORG> are also in the process of restarting . 

With <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s prized crude pumping through the desert to the coastal terminal of <LOC> Ras Lanuf </LOC> , workers say the country ¡¯s largest refinery could restart within days , with around 300,000 barrels of oil from stocks already built up in tanks there . 

Workers have been flown in on cargo flights but many pilots are nervous to cross <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s skies that are still subject to a <ORG> NATO </ORG> - enforced no - fly zone . 

Yet , hopes are high for a quick recovery . 

¡° We are preparing to bring back all employees , nothing here has been damaged , ¡± said <PER> Amal </PER> field general manager <PER> Saad Ali Eshiem </PER> . 

But fears of an attack loom large and many Libyans are reluctant to leave the safety of their hometowns for remote sites southeast of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , where fighting continues , and few foreign workers have returned . 

With sites operating with a fraction of their pre - war workforces , small teams onsite say output will at best reach 50 percent of total capacity without the help of their colleagues . 

Oil flows will also depend on the condition of wells and pipes that have not been used for eight or nine months . 

Foreign companies contacted by <ORG> Reuters </ORG> declined to say when they would redeploy workers to the fields near <LOC> Jakhira </LOC> . 

<LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Suncor </ORG> said last week it was too early to comment on operations at its <ORG> Amal field </ORG> ( jointly owned with <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> - based <ORG> Agoco </ORG> ) while <ORG> Occidental </ORG> declined to comment on its 70,000 bpd Nafoora field also restarting in the area . 

Oil fields are on high - alert , and men armed with AK-47 rifles continue to patrol sites day and night , while pick - up trucks mounted with machine guns patrol nearby areas . 

As fighters loyal to <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s interim government continue to battle for control of central parts of the country , it could be months before oil workers lower their guard and the rest of the work force returns . 

And while in other areas , off - shore fields operated by <LOC> France </LOC> ¡¯s Total and fields further east operated by <MISC> Italian </MISC> oil and gas company <ORG> Eni </ORG> have also restarted , <MISC> Libyan </MISC> exports are still only trickling back into the world market . 

<LOC> North Africa </LOC> ¡¯s fourth - largest producer exported 1.3 million bpd before the war , and since resuming production in September , has sold only a fraction of pre - war output . 

On Friday , the OPEC member sold its fourth cargo of crude oil to <MISC> Austrian </MISC> energy group <ORG> OMV </ORG> and <MISC> Swiss </MISC> refiner <ORG> PetroPlus </ORG> . 

And while firms have been brisk to restart output at fields that escaped the war relatively unscathed , others are already reported to have suffered major damage and some fields remain too dangerous to inspect . 

Earlier this week , <ORG> Reuters </ORG> reported an engineer had discovered <ORG> Eni </ORG> ¡¯s largest oil field in <LOC> Libya </LOC> , known as Elephant , lay in ruins , after volunteering to inspect the site with a squad of fighters .

<MISC> Libyan </MISC> transitional government forces seized the main hospital in the city of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> on Sunday , a <ORG> Reuters </ORG> witness said , capturing more than a dozen fighters loyal to former leader <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> who had used the buildings to launch mortars and rocket - propelled grenades . 

¡° We are trying to evacuate the sick and wounded , ¡± said <PER> Salah Mustafa </PER> , a commander of the government forces . 

Most of the Gaddafi militia fled , some of them have disguised themselves as doctors . 

Some 15 Gaddafi loyalists were marched out of the buildings and one was punched on the back of the head when <ORG> NTC </ORG> forces found a picture of the deposed leader in his pocket .

Workers protesting at the headquarters of <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s National Oil Company on Sunday said they would strike until managers were replaced and possibly tried for fighting alongside Gaddafi . 

Most of the crowd worked for Waha Oil , a joint venture with <MISC> American </MISC> firms <ORG> ConocoPhillips </ORG> , Marathon and <ORG> Amerada Hess </ORG> . 

Documents proving managers had used the Waha Oil complex as a base for <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> fighters had been presented to the NOC chairman that morning , protesters said . 

The oil fields had been targeted by <ORG> NATO </ORG> because they were used to feed , shelter and equip loyalist fighters , according to the workers , who said it could take four to six months to restart flows . 

¡° There is a lot of damage at the fields ... especially at <LOC> Gialo </LOC> and <LOC> Waha </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Ahmed Zahmun </PER> , a Waha Oil protester . 

In an interview last week , the <ORG> NOC ¡¯s </ORG> chairman told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> that <ORG> NATO </ORG> airstrikes on <MISC> Libyan </MISC> oil fields had been executed with ¡° surgical precision . 

A source at <ORG> NOC </ORG> confirmed <PER> Nouri Berouin </PER> , the chairman , had met Waha Oil workers on Sunday , but added requests to remove directors had not been heeded . 

Other North <MISC> American </MISC> firms in <LOC> Libya </LOC> are facing contrasting fortunes , with <ORG> Occidental </ORG> and <ORG> Suncor </ORG> both restarting production at fields in the eastern part of the <LOC> Sirte basin </LOC> this week . 

<MISC> European </MISC> companies , including <MISC> German </MISC> , <MISC> Italian </MISC> and <MISC> French </MISC> oil firms , have also succeeded in pumping oil for the first time since war broke out , but they have met with mixed fates as well . 

Last week an operations manager at <ORG> Eni </ORG> ¡¯s headquarters in <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> the <MISC> Italian </MISC> oil and gas company ¡¯s largest oilfield , Elephant , lay in ruins and would not restart until 2012 . 

<ORG> Eni </ORG> ¡¯s CEO later said the company did not know of any damage to the field . 

So far , oil has yet to flow from the West and parts of <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s oil - rich basin remain too dangerous to inspect . 

Waha Oil pumped just under 400,000 barrels of oil per day ( bpd ) before the war , but is now producing no crude and field workers say they will not return until managers were replaced . 

Protesters said <MISC> Libyans </MISC> had been denied the opportunity to get a good job throughout Gaddafi ¡¯s rule and wanted a better future . 

¡° After more than 40 years , we are still relying on foreign workers . 

<MISC> Libyans </MISC> have no chance to get a good position . 

There is no future strategy , ¡± said <PER> Ahmed Zahmoul </PER> . 

Sunday ¡¯s protest followed a similar demonstration last week at <LOC> Waha </LOC> Oil ¡¯s headquarters . 

Engineers there reported damage was severe in parts of the complex , while some oil fields were still unsafe to visit . 

<ORG> Waha </ORG> Oil workers were joined by employees at the <ORG> Libyan Petroleum Institute </ORG> , who also said their managers had actively supported <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> ¡¯s army . 

The army came there for rifles and machine guns , ¡± said <PER> Ibrahim Twebti </PER> , an employee at the institute . 

Punishment was up to the <MISC> Libyan </MISC> court charged with processing Gaddafi loyalists , protesters said , but whatever the result , managers were unqualified for their jobs and should not be allowed to stay on . 

We want to change that , ¡± said <PER> Hatem Wafa </PER> , a geophysicist at the protest . 

<LOC> SIRTE </LOC> , <LOC> Libya </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Rocket holes pockmark its concrete walls , the glass is riddled with bullets and blood stains the marble staircase in what is left of the luxurious seaside hotel in <LOC> Muammar Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s hometown of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> . 

The seven - floor building , replete with luxurious beach villas , indoor swimming pools and Jacuzzis overlooking the Mediterranean , was built by Gaddafi to host world leaders and state guests . 

But , completed only recently , the hotel has not seen any of those guests , and now the rag - tag army of civilians battling to take the coastal city from <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> loyalists are the first ones to arrive . 

¡° It is a brand new hotel , no one ever slept here before , the revolutionaries are the first people , ¡± said fighter <PER> Saleh al </PER> - <PER> Wared </PER> , as he moved from one room to another showing journalists around . 

Come see where is the phone , it is in the bathroom ... 

you can only dream to stay in this place . 

Others were taking videos of each other swimming in the indoor pool and enjoying some of the luxury that was formerly the preserve of foreign guests and the ruling elite . 

Fighters loyal to <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s new interim rulers say the hotel , with its conference halls , meeting rooms , restaurants and shops , gym and spa , was meant to house <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s guests . 

¡° It was built for the delegations that come to Muammar . 

Normal people can not stay here , except if you had money , maybe 500 - 600 dinars a night , ¡± said <ORG> NTC </ORG> fighter <PER> Ayad </PER> . 

The rooms , with their flat - screen televisions , marble floors and mahogany wooden wardrobes , are now used by fighters with the <ORG> National Transitional Council </ORG> to fire their heavy machine guns at <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> loyalists . 

They take cover behind mattresses and tables when snipers open fire . 

An empty Jacuzzi on a balcony is used to store ammunition . 

He ( <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> ) called the villas after the names of his sons and family members , ¡± <PER> Wared </PER> said , of the U - shape private villas on the <LOC> sandy Mediterranean </LOC> beaches . 

¡° <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> and the east , that was <LOC> Libya </LOC> . 

Here , this is the Great Jamahiriyah , ¡± he said , referring to the quixotic system of rule built up during 42 years under Gaddafi . 

The <LOC> Sirte </LOC> hotel is similar to many other opulent five - star hotels in other oil - rich <MISC> Arab </MISC> countries , but stands in contrast with the run - down hotels in <LOC> Libya </LOC> ¡¯s second - biggest city of <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> in the east . 

Many <MISC> Libyans </MISC> resent Gaddafi and his family for their lavish lifestyle and say residents of <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> and <LOC> Sirte </LOC> are wealthier than the rest of the country . 

In <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> , people blame years of decay , neglect and isolation ¡ª symbolized by the city ¡¯s crumbling buildings , broken roads and narrow rubbish - strewn alleys and swarms of flies ¡ª on <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s one - man - rule . 

They say Gaddafi took better care of the capital <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> and <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , his hometown and the bastion of his tribe , al - <PER> Gaddafa </PER> , because the once ¡° Brother Leader ¡± feared <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> ¡¯s rebellious nature would threaten his rule . 

¡° It is the first time in our lives that we see something like this hotel and now we are staying in it with our weapons , ¡± said <ORG> NTC </ORG> fighter <PER> Osama Rajab Najem </PER> , from <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> . 

¡° They used to search us every time we would come to the gates of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> . 

Sometimes they would know by our dialect that we were from <LOC> Benghazi </LOC> . ¡± 

Now they say they will rebuild <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , which has been under heavy bombardment by <ORG> NTC </ORG> and <ORG> NATO </ORG> forces over the past weeks . 

Smoke rises above the city and many of its buildings and infrastructure are now in ruins . 

In one example , <ORG> NTC </ORG> fighters have blown up a green concrete gate , 50 km from <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , but the blast did not completely demolish the gate , seen as a symbol of <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> ¡¯s rule . 

Fighters then showered it with bullets . 

The names of their dead are written on the remaining concrete . 

We do n¡¯t want anything that reminds us of Muammar , ¡± said one of the rebels manning the checkpoint into the city . 

By the time we enter <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , there will be no Sirte , ¡± another <ORG> NTC </ORG> fighter said on the frontline a few kilometers away from the city center , as tanks and artillery fired at buildings where <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> loyalists are thought to be hiding . 

As he surveyed the damage , he shrugged his shoulders and added : ¡° We will rebuild <LOC> Sirte </LOC> . ¡± 

About 80 representatives of <MISC> Syrian </MISC> opposition groups met for talks in <LOC> Sweden </LOC> on Saturday in a quest to unify efforts to unseat autocratic President <PER> Bashar al </PER> - <PER> Assad </PER> , whose military has been trying to crush months of popular unrest . 

The meeting included the chairman of the recently <ORG> formed National Council </ORG> , as well as representatives from inside <LOC> Syria </LOC> . 

The goal is to coordinate the efforts of the whole of the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> opposition in the face of this regime , <ORG> ¡± organisation </ORG> chairman <PER> Bourhan Ghalioun </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> at the conference centre in countryside outside the <MISC> Swedish </MISC> capital . 

He said the meeting , set to run through Sunday and hosted by the <MISC> Palme </MISC> Centre , a <ORG> democracy and rights organisation </ORG> , aimed to arrive at a ¡° <LOC> Stockholm </LOC> Action Plan 

The Council came together a week ago in <LOC> Istanbul </LOC> and included the <ORG> Muslim Brotherhood </ORG> , the <LOC> Damascus </LOC> Declaration ¡ª which is the main grouping of established opposition figures ¡ª and grassroots activists . 

The <ORG> United Nations </ORG> says more than 2,900 people , including 100 children , have been killed in six months of protests . 

The figure does not include people who have disappeared . 

The 46-year - old <PER> Assad </PER> , who inherited power from his father in 2000 , blames the violence on armed gangs backed by foreign forces , while his officials say 700 police and soldiers have been killed , as well as 700 ¡° mutineers ¡± . 

The authorities have dismissed the opposition organising outside <LOC> Syria </LOC> as a foreign conspiracy to sow sectarian strife . 

<PER> Ghalioun </PER> said the opposition ¡¯s goal was the peaceful removal of the <PER> Assad </PER> government and that the international community had to do more to help this come about . 

¡° We demand that the international community assume its responsibilities and find ways to protect <MISC> Syrian </MISC> civilians , ¡± he added , sharply criticising <LOC> Russia </LOC> for helping block a <ORG> U.N. Security Council </ORG> resolution on <LOC> Syria </LOC> . 

¡° It is scandalous that <LOC> Russia </LOC> accepts or even encourages ... the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> regime to continue its violence against the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> people . 

I think that the <MISC> democratic </MISC> community has not done enough to oblige the <MISC> Russians </MISC> and the <MISC> Syrians </MISC> to respect <MISC> Syrian </MISC> human rights , ¡± he said . 

<LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> China </LOC> , which with the <LOC> United States </LOC> are veto - wielding permanent members of the <ORG> Security Council </ORG> , blocked a <MISC> European </MISC> - drafted resolution urging <LOC> Syria </LOC> to halt its six - month crackdown on pro - democracy demonstrators . 

<LOC> VIENNA </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Eleven people were arrested in <LOC> Vienna </LOC> on Saturday after they broke into a building housing the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> embassy and consulate , a police spokeswoman said . 

Around 20 people had been taking part in an anti - <MISC> Syrian </MISC> government demonstration in the early hours . 

¡° Some people broke through the door into the embassy building , ¡± the spokeswoman said . 

Large political protests are generally rare in <LOC> Vienna </LOC> , but there have been several small anti - <MISC> Syrian </MISC> government protests in the past months . 

<MISC> Syrian </MISC> President <PER> Bashar al </PER> - <PER> Assad </PER> has sent troops and tanks to crush protests against him that erupted in March . 

He has ended a state of emergency and promised a parliamentary election in February .

¡° We will take tough measures against any state which recognizes this illegitimate council , ¡± Foreign Minister <PER> Walid al </PER> - <PER> Moualem </PER> told a news conference broadcast by <MISC> Syrian </MISC> television . 

The formation of the council has been welcomed by Western countries including the <LOC> United States </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> . 

However , unlike the <ORG> transitional council </ORG> set up by <MISC> Libyan </MISC> rebels who overthrew <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> , they have not offered it any formal recognition . 

The <ORG> United Nations </ORG> says 2,900 people have been killed in <PER> Assad </PER> ¡¯s crackdown on six months of mainly peaceful protests . 

On Saturday , activists said security forces killed at least two people when they opened fire on tens of thousands of mourners at the funeral of a <MISC> Kurdish </MISC> opposition figure . 

<PER> Moualem </PER> described <PER> Mishaal al </PER> - <PER> Tammo </PER> as a martyr killed by terrorists , suggesting he was targeted because he opposed foreign intervention in <LOC> Syria </LOC> . 

<PER> Tammo </PER> ¡¯s family have blamed <MISC> Syrian </MISC> authorities for his death . 

<PER> Moualem </PER> also criticized <MISC> European </MISC> countries where he said <MISC> Syrian </MISC> embassies had been attacked by protesters , saying that if they did not meet their obligations to protect foreign missions <LOC> Syria </LOC> would respond in similar fashion . 

He was speaking at a joint news conference with ministers from five <MISC> Latin American </MISC> countries , who were visiting <LOC> Syria </LOC> to show support for <PER> Assad </PER> ¡¯s government . 

It was n't exactly a knockout , but DreamWorks ' robot - boxing movie " Real Steel " packed enough punch to win the domestic box office this weekend with $ 27.3 million . 

The opening at 3,440 locations for the <PER> Shawn Levy </PER> - directed film was in line with most pre - release expectations ¡ª but perhaps a little light for a movie that cost more than $ 110 million to make . 

The film also grossed $ 22.1 million opening in 19 foreign territories , including <LOC> Australia </LOC> , <LOC> Mexico </LOC> and <LOC> Russia </LOC> . 

The near - future - set " Real Steel , " which stars <PER> Hugh Jackman </PER> , received an A - plus Cinemascore grade for all younger demographic groups . 

" It 's a great start relative to our expectations , " said <PER> Dave Hollis </PER> , distribution chief for <ORG> DreamWorks </ORG> ' distribution partner , <ORG> Disney </ORG> ; on Thursday , <PER> Hollis </PER> had put the pre - release bar at around $ 23 million - $ 25 million .

With many schools closed for the <MISC> Columbus Day </MISC> holiday Monday , <ORG> Disney </ORG> and <ORG> DreamWorks </ORG> officials are hoping the film 's strong exit polling comes into play . 

<PER> George Clooney </PER> 's latest adult drama , " The Ides of March , " meanwhile , was also solid if unspectacular , opening to $ 10.4 million at 2,199 theaters and finishing No . 2 at the box office . 

<ORG> Sony </ORG> was quick to note that the opening is similar to the October 2007 start for <PER> Clooney </PER> 's " <PER> Michael Clayton </PER> , " which also opened to $ 10.4 million and ultimately grossed a solid $ 49 million domestically . 

" This picture will have a multiple of around five times , as well , " said <ORG> Sony </ORG> distirbution president <PER> Rory Bruer </PER> . 

" We 're in the top of the range we had hoped to be in . " 

Written by , <ORG> directed and co </ORG> - <PER> starring Clooney </PER> , political drama 

" The Ides of March " was produced out of <PER> Clooney </PER> 's Smokehouse shingle for around $ 18 million . 

The movie 's all - star cast includes <PER> Ryan Gosling </PER> , <PER> Evan Rachel Wood </PER> , <PER> Philip Seymour Hoffman </PER> and <PER> Paul Giamatti </PER> . 

Reviews were aggregated at around 82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes , but Cinemascore exit - polling this weekend only pegged the film at a B grade .

About 58 percent of the movie 's audience was female , and about 60 percent was over the age of 25 . 

Overall , the domestic box office was virtually flat with the same weekend last year ( down about 1 percent ) . 

Notably , both <ORG> Disney </ORG> and <ORG> Sony </ORG> crossed the $ 1 billion mark in domestic revenue over the weekend . 

A strong group of holdovers , meanwhile , continues to hold strong , with <ORG> Warner / Alcon </ORG> Entertainment 's " <MISC> Dolphin Tale </MISC> " finishing third with $ 9.2 million in its third weekend , a week - to - week drop of only around 37 percent for the family film .

No . 2 , also dropping less than 40 percent to $ 5.5 million . 

Among limited releases , <MISC> IFC horror shocker </MISC> " The Human Centipede 2 : Full Sequence " grossed about $ 54,000 playing at 18 late - night engagements , seen only by enough moviegoers to form a nice conga line to the exits .

Idealism Gets Assassinated in <PER> Clooney </PER> 's ' Ides of March ' 

The <ORG> European Union </ORG> said on Sunday it plans to invite <MISC> Israeli </MISC> and <MISC> Palestinian </MISC> representatives to meet ¡° in the coming days ¡± to discuss resuming peace negotiations . 

But it was not immediately clear whether such an invitation could resolve a year - long impasse in diplomacy , as spokesmen for both <LOC> Israel </LOC> and the <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> responded by restating long - held positions already blamed for perpetuating the stalemate . 

The announcement by <PER> Catherine Ashton </PER> , High Representative of the <ORG> Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy </ORG> , was made after a meeting of the <LOC> Middle East </LOC> Quartet ¡ª 

the <ORG> EU </ORG> , the <LOC> United States </LOC> , <LOC> Russia </LOC> and the <ORG> United Nations </ORG> . 

The Quartet discussed what to do next to encourage the two sides to resume ¡° substantive ¡± negotiations as soon as possible . 

<MISC> Palestinian </MISC> President <PER> Mahmoud Abbas </PER> has demanded that <LOC> Israel </LOC> halt all settlement building in the occupied <LOC> West Bank </LOC> before <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> will restart talks . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> has made clear it is not ready to suspend settlement expansion beyond a 10-month hiatus it implemented a year ago , an issue over which <LOC> U.S </LOC> .- sponsored negotiations between the sides have remained frozen since September 2010 . 

Last month , <PER> Abbas </PER> formally asked the <ORG> United Nations </ORG> to recognize a <MISC> Palestinian </MISC> state in the <LOC> West Bank </LOC> and <LOC> Gaza Strip </LOC> , a move opposed by <LOC> Israel </LOC> and the <LOC> United States </LOC> . 

They say only a negotiated peace can end the <LOC> Middle East </LOC> conflict and create a <MISC> Palestinian </MISC> state alongside <LOC> Israel </LOC> . 

In response to <PER> Ashton </PER> ¡¯s statement , <PER> Nabil Abu Rdainah </PER> , a spokesman for <PER> Abbas </PER> , said that if <LOC> Israel </LOC> ¡° recognizes the 1967 borders and freezes settlements , we are ready to go immediately ¡± to talks the <ORG> EU </ORG> seeks to convene . 

In <LOC> Jerusalem </LOC> , an <MISC> Israeli </MISC> official contacted by <ORG> Reuters </ORG> would not comment on the planned invitation , but suggested <LOC> Israel </LOC> would be ready to attend if no conditions were attached . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> has ¡° repeatedly expressed its willingness to start direct peace talks with the <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> face to face without any preconditions whatsoever , ¡± the official said . 

He added : ¡° We hope the <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> will be ready , too . ¡±

The beaming couple emerged from the grey - <LOC> stone Old Marylebone Town Hall </LOC> to confetti and cheers from dozens of fans who had waited hours to catch a glimpse of the music legend and his new wife . 

<PER> Brunette Shevell </PER> , 51 , wore a knee - length , long - sleeved white dress which reports said was designed by <PER> McCartney </PER> ¡¯s fashion designer daughter <PER> Stella </PER> . 

The bride also had a white flower in her hair and carried a small posy of roses , while ¡°

Rock¡¯n¡¯roll royalty including <PER> Starr </PER> , Rolling Stone <PER> Ronnie Wood </PER> and guitarist <PER> Jeff Beck </PER> attended the reception , as did model Twiggy and artist <PER> Tracey Emin </PER> . 

Late Beatle <PER> George Harrison </PER> ¡¯s widow <PER> Olivia </PER> turned up to the soiree , which was also designed to be a low - key affair . 

<PER> McCartney </PER> ¡¯s spokesman declined to divulge any details of the wedding day , but celebrity - hungry tabloids in <LOC> Britain </LOC> , where the affectionately named ¡° Macca ¡± is hugely popular , have been poring over every detail . 

According to reports , <PER> McCartney </PER> composed a song for <PER> Shevell </PER> especially for their big day .

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 7 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <ORG> China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp </ORG> ( <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> ) is expected to relaunch its 270 pence a share offer for uranium miner <ORG> Kalahari Minerals </ORG> following a three - month block imposed by <LOC> UK </LOC> regulators . 

An announcement could come as soon as next week , ¡± a source familiar with the situation told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> , adding that the deal 

is expected to be on the same terms as an earlier 270-pence per share offer . 

State - owned <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> was in talks in March to buy Kalahari for 290 pence a share . 

In the days following the earthquake and nuclear disaster in <LOC> Japan </LOC> , the companies agreed <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> could cut the price to 270 pence , but they failed to persuade <LOC> UK </LOC> regulators and <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> was forced to withdraw its informal bid . 

A 270 pence bid would value AIM - listed Kalahari at just over 650 million pounds ( $ 1 billion ) and would represent a 14-percent premium to the current 236.3 pence share price . 

<ORG> Kalahari </ORG> shares had closed at 226p the day before <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> withdrew its offer on May 11 . 

<LOC> Kalahari </LOC> holds a 43-percent stake in Extract Resources 

, owner of the <MISC> Husab </MISC> project in <LOC> Namibia </LOC> , which is potentially the second - largest uranium mine in the world . 

<LOC> Kalahari </LOC> had not demanded payment of a 7.5 million pound break fee from its <MISC> Chinese </MISC> suitors after <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> was forced to drop its earlier offer , leaving the door open for a future move . 

The <LOC> UK </LOC> Takeover Panel ruled in May that <ORG> CGNPC </ORG> could not announce a firm offer at 270 pence per share , even with the agreement of the <ORG> Kalahari board </ORG> , and would have to wait three months if it wanted to return with an offer lower than the original 290 pence a share proposal . 

Opportunistic M&A deals are expected to pick up in the sector as current valuation levels for miners are edging closer to lows hit during the 2008 crisis , making potential targets cheap for cashed - up buyers .

Minors in the state of <LOC> California </LOC> will no longer be allowed to use tanning beds after Governor <PER> Jerry Brown </PER> signed a bill on Sunday prohibiting anyone under the age of 18 from using ultraviolet tanning devices . 

<LOC> California </LOC> is the first state in the nation to ban minors from using tanning beds , legislators said . 

Previously , <LOC> California </LOC> had banned minors under the age of 14 from using tanning beds , but allowed those between 14 and 18 years of age to use tanning beds with parental consent . 

The bill was part of a cluster of legislation signed on Sunday designed to ¡° improve the health and well - being of Calfornians , ¡± according to a statement from the Governor ¡¯s office .

Activists reported clashes across the country Sunday , from <LOC> Jabal al </LOC> - <LOC> Zawiyah </LOC> near the northern border with <LOC> Turkey </LOC> to the southern province of <LOC> Deraa </LOC> . 

The <ORG> Syrian Observatory for Human rights </ORG> said seven people were killed in shooting in the central city of <LOC> Homs </LOC> , adding that by late evening communications to the city were cut after the sound of explosions were heard . 

Three people were also killed in rural areas around the city of <LOC> Hama </LOC> during fighting between troops and gunmen believed to be army defectors , the <MISC> British </MISC> - based organization said . 

It said there were also fatalities in clashes between the army and suspected defectors in <LOC> Jabal al </LOC> - <LOC> Zawiyah </LOC> and in <LOC> Dael </LOC> , in <LOC> Deraa </LOC> province , but gave no death tolls for those clashes . 

In the town of <LOC> Dumeir </LOC> , 40 km ( 25 miles ) northeast of <LOC> Damascus </LOC> , the <LOC> Observatory </LOC> said security forces killed three people Sunday when they opened fire on the funeral procession of a youth whose body was returned after he died in captivity . 

The grassroots Local Coordination Committees group put Sunday ¡¯s death toll at 17 . 

Foreign media are largely barred from entering <LOC> Syria </LOC> and it was not possible to confirm the reports independently . 

Saturday , activists said security forces killed at least two people when they shot at tens of thousands of mourners at the funeral of a <MISC> Kurdish </MISC> opposition figure . 

<PER> Moualem </PER> described <PER> Mishaal al </PER> - <PER> Tammo </PER> as a martyr killed by terrorists , suggesting he was targeted because he opposed foreign intervention in <LOC> Syria </LOC> . 

<PER> Tammo </PER> ¡¯s family have blamed <MISC> Syrian </MISC> authorities for his death . 

<LOC> Turkey </LOC> condemned <PER> Tammo </PER> ¡¯s ¡° heinous assassination ¡± and also criticised the reported assault on another prominent opposition figure , former parliamentarian <PER> Riad Seif </PER> , appearing to blame <MISC> Syrian </MISC> authorities for both attacks . 

¡° <LOC> Turkey </LOC> expects the <MISC> Syrian </MISC> administration to realize as soon as possible that the acts of violence designed to suppress the opposition in <LOC> Syria </LOC> ... can not turn back the course of history , ¡± a foreign ministry statement said . 

Once a close ally of <PER> Assad </PER> ¡¯s , <LOC> Turkey </LOC> has hosted several meetings of the opposition <ORG> National Council </ORG> . 

It has also given shelter to thousands of <MISC> Syrian </MISC> refugees , as well as the most senior <MISC> Syrian </MISC> army officer to defect from <PER> Assad </PER> ¡¯s military . 

<ORG> CNN Turk channel </ORG> said Sunday <MISC> Syrian </MISC> police were stopping <MISC> Turkish </MISC> citizens from entering <LOC> Syria </LOC> at the border town of <LOC> Nusaybin </LOC> , a few miles ( km ) north of <LOC> Qamishli </LOC> where <PER> Tammo </PER> was killed , because of increased tensions in the area . 

Prime Minister <PER> Tayyip Erdogan </PER> has said he plans to impose sanctions on <LOC> Syria </LOC> and has launched military exercises in <LOC> Hatay </LOC> province , where <LOC> Syria </LOC> has a longstanding territorial claim . 

¡° <LOC> Syria </LOC> ¡¯s hands are not tied , ¡± <PER> Moualem </PER> responded . 

Whoever throws a rose at it , it will throw a rose back . ¡± 

The official <ORG> SANA </ORG> news agency said <PER> Assad </PER> told the ministers from <LOC> Venezuela </LOC> , <LOC> Cuba </LOC> , <LOC> Bolivia </LOC> , <LOC> Ecuador </LOC> and <LOC> Nicaragua </LOC> , part of a group at odds with the <LOC> United States </LOC> , that <LOC> Syria </LOC> was focusing on ¡° political reform ... and ending the phenomenon of armed ( groups ) . 

In response to the protests , <PER> Assad </PER> has formally ended nearly 50 years of emergency rule and pledged multi - party parliamentary elections next year , but opponents say the moves are meaningless while security forces continue to kill protesters . 

Diplomats and analysts say the protests have been largely peaceful but there have been a steady flow of army defections and increasing reports of armed clashes with security forces . 

¡° Many in the West say this is a peaceful revolution and 

( these are ) peaceful demonstrations , ¡± <PER> Moualem </PER> said . 

They do not acknowledge the presence of armed terrorist groups , ( but ) they finance them and smuggle weapons to them . ¡± 

<PER> Bourhan Ghalioun </PER> , chairman of the opposition <ORG> National Council </ORG> , said in <LOC> Sweden </LOC> Saturday the organization was seeking <PER> Assad </PER> ¡¯s removal by peaceful methods and called on global powers to do more to help achieve this goal . 

¡° We demand that the international community assume its responsibilities and find ways to help protect <MISC> Syrian </MISC> civilians , ¡± he said , sharply criticising <LOC> Russia </LOC> for helping block a <ORG> U.N. Security Council </ORG> resolution on <LOC> Syria </LOC>

* <LOC> Rio </LOC> first foreign miner to comply with law 

* Empowerment drive seen linked to elections 

* Foreign mines must choose local partners from govt list 

* Miners want to sell up to 30 percent stakes 

<ORG> Rio Tinto </ORG> has told <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> ¡¯s government it will give up a 51 percent stake in its local diamond unit Murowa , state media reported on Saturday , making it the first foreign - owned firm to voluntarily comply with the country ¡¯s local ownership law . 

¡° Murowa Diamonds wrote to us ( on Thursday ) saying they have given up 51 percent of shares and these would be given to our people , ¡± <PER> Kasukuwere </PER> told the official <ORG> Herald </ORG> newspaper . 

Murowa officials were not available for comment . 

The heavily criticised law is aimed mainly at mining firms and banks operating in the resource - rich country , which has become an economic basket case because of what analysts say are years of mismanagement by President <PER> Robert Mugabe </PER> ¡¯s government . 

Last month , Indigenisation and Empowerment Minister <PER> Saviour Kasukuwere </PER> said mining firms had mostly met a September deadline by which they were required to submit plans to transfer a 51 percent stake in their operations to locals . 

The world ¡¯s number one and two platinum producers , <MISC> Anglo American </MISC> Platinum and <ORG> Impala </ORG> Platinum are also major foreign mining firms with assets in <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> . 

Critics have said a major reason for the law is to allow Mugabe ¡¯s <ORG> ZANU </ORG> - <ORG> PF </ORG> party to build up a war chest ahead of national elections that could come as early as next year . 

They say <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> , emerging from a decade - long slump , can not raise the funds needed to take over the mining assets and the cash generated by the firms would go to top officials , not ordinary people , who rank among the poorest in the world . 

Regulations supporting the empowerment law require miners 

to choose local partners from a government approved list , which Prime Minister <PER> Morgan Tsvangirai </PER> ¡¯s <ORG> Movement for Democratic Change </ORG> ( <ORG> MDC </ORG> ) party says is meant to benefit Mugabe ¡¯s allies . 

<PER> Mugabe </PER> was forced to share power with <PER> Tsvangirai </PER> two years ago after disputed elections in 2008 . 

The two have sharp differences over the ownership policy . 

My overall assessment is that over 90 percent of the submitted proposals do not meet the minimum requirements ( of choosing partners from a government list ) and there seems to be an element of resistance , ¡± <PER> Kasukuwere </PER> was quoted as saying . 

<PER> Kasukuwere </PER> also said plans submitted by foreign mines generally show the companies want to sell a maximum of 30 percent of shares while the remaining 21 percent would be made up of empowerment credits awarded for social investments made in infrastructure , health and education facilities . 

<ORG> Implats </ORG> unit <ORG> Zimplats </ORG> , which is the largest platinum producer in <LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> was given up to next month to fully comply with the empowerment law . 

<LOC> Zimbabwe </LOC> has the world ¡¯s second - largest known platinum reserves after neighbouring <LOC> South Africa </LOC> and market watchers and investors are therefore keen to see how the situation unfolds against the backdrop of red - hot commodity prices .

* <PER> Tusk </PER> claims victory , <PER> Kaczynski concedes </PER> defeat 

* Financial markets sure to welcome result 

* Exit poll shows current coalition will have majority 

By <PER> Gabriela Baczynska </PER> and <PER> Pawel Sobczak </PER> 

<LOC> WARSAW </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> Polish </MISC> voters handed Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> ¡¯s centre - right Civic Platform four more years in power on Sunday , exit polls showed , paving the way for him to pursue cautious economic reforms and closer ties with the rest of the <ORG> EU </ORG> . 

An exit poll showed <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s pro - business party was on course to win 39.6 percent of votes in a parliamentary election , short of an absolute majority but far ahead of <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s nationalist - conservative <ORG> Law and Justice party </ORG> on 30.1 percent . 

It is the first time a ruling party has been re - elected in the country of 38 million since the fall of communism in 1989 . 

Financial markets are expected to welcome the result , which points to four more years of relative political and economic stability in the <ORG> European Union </ORG> ¡¯s largest eastern member state at a time of deepening crisis in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone . 

¡° I wanted to thank all of those who voted for us and those who did n¡¯t because we will be together bearing responsibility for <LOC> Poland </LOC> for four more years , 

¡± <PER> Tusk </PER> , 54 , said in a victory speech to cheers at his party ¡¯s headquarters . 

<PER> Kaczynski </PER> conceded defeat and the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> , <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s 

junior coalition partner for the past four years , said it was ready to renew the alliance . 

Projections based on the exit poll , conducted by <ORG> TNS OBOP </ORG> for national television , showed the two parties would have enough seats to secure a majority in the Sejm or lower house . 

<MISC> Polish </MISC> President <PER> Bronislaw Komorowski </PER> , a former Civic Platform lawmaker , is now expected to ask <PER> Tusk </PER> to form a government 

but he said he must first wait for the official election results , expected on Tuesday evening . 

¡° I hope that it will be possible to reduce the time necessary for creating the government ... to a minimum , ¡± he said . 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> was the only <ORG> EU </ORG> member state not to sink into recession during the 2008 - 09 global economic crisis . 

This is a vote for stability more than anything else , ¡± said <PER> Nicholas Spiro </PER> , head of <PER> Spiro </PER> Sovereign Strategy , a <LOC> London </LOC> - based consultancy . 

¡° From a market standpoint , one of the key anchors of <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s creditworthiness has remained in place . 

Given the rapidly deteriorating external backdrop , there is an even bigger premium on political stability in <LOC> Poland </LOC> . ¡± 

But he also cautioned that Civil Platform ¡¯s preference for caution left questions over whether the next government would carry out the kind of fiscal and structural reforms that <LOC> Poland </LOC> needs . 

Finance Minister <PER> Jacek Rostowski </PER> said he was ready to remain in his post and reiterated his intention to reduce <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s budget deficit to below 3 percent of gross domestic product next year , in line with promises to the <ORG> EU </ORG> . 

Civic Platform has also vowed to press on with a privatisation programme expected to bring in 15 billion zlotys 

( $ 4.6 billion ) this year and 10 billion zlotys in 2012 . 

An aide to <PER> Tusk </PER> said the prime minister would continue his policy of gradual economic reforms . 

At a time of global crisis , such turmoil on the global markets , even gradual reforms will require brave decisions and our coalition will continue to do them effectively , ¡± said the aide , <PER> Michal Boni </PER> . 

The post - <ORG> communist Democratic Left Alliance </ORG> won 7.7 percent ¡ª a surprisingly poor result ¡ª the rural - based <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> 8.2 percent , and a new liberal grouping called <PER> Palikot </PER> ¡¯s Movement 10.1 percent , the exit poll showed . 

Projected results based on the exit poll showed Civic Platform and the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> should have 239 seats in the 450-seat Sejm . 

The result is a personal triumph for <PER> Tusk </PER> , a pragmatic liberal conservative from near <LOC> Gdansk </LOC> on <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s 

<MISC> Baltic </MISC> coast who was involved in the Solidarity movement that helped end decades of communist rule . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> 

percent of gross national product ( GDP ) this year , and to rein in public debt , seen at 53.8 percent of GDP , or face the risk of <LOC> Poland </LOC> being downgraded by ratings agencies . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> also favours closer integration with the rest of the <ORG> EU </ORG> and says joining the <MISC> euro </MISC> remains a strategic goal for <LOC> Poland </LOC> despite the debt crisis in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone . 

<PER> Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s calls for a halt to privatisation , for higher taxes on the wealthy and for a more combative stance in dealings with <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> EU </ORG> partners had unsettled investors . 

A government led by <PER> Kaczynski </PER> , 62 , would have been likely to strain <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s relations with its two large neighbours , <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> , as happened when law and Justice 

was last in power from 

2005 to 2007 . 

<PER> Kaczynski distrusts </PER> both <LOC> Berlin </LOC> and <LOC> Moscow </LOC> 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> was carved up under a <MISC> Nazi </MISC> - <MISC> Soviet </MISC> pact before World War Two ¡ª and raised eyebrows during the election campaign by repeating in a new book his view that <LOC> Berlin </LOC> is trying to subdue <LOC> Poland </LOC> . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> has good personal ties with <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and has maintained a cautious rapprochement with <LOC> Moscow </LOC> , despite strains over a plane crash last year that killed then - President <PER> Lech Kaczynski </PER> , <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s twin . 

An unapologetic Pastor <PER> Robert Jeffress </PER> , who created a stir for calling Mormonism a ¡° cult ¡± at a political gathering , told hundreds of congregants at his <LOC> Texas </LOC> megachurch on Sunday that he welcomed the opportunity he ¡¯s had to warn people about a ¡° false religion . ¡± 

I have not changed my position , ¡± <PER> Jeffress </PER> told the crowd of about 2,000 attending the early service at First Baptist Church of <LOC> Dallas </LOC> . 

The TV evangelist and prominent religious leader spent the last two days defending statements he made to reporters at a conservative gathering on Friday in <LOC> Washington </LOC> DC , in which he called Mormonism a ¡° cult ¡± just minutes after introducing and endorsing <LOC> Texas </LOC> <MISC> Republican </MISC> presidential candidate <PER> Rick Perry </PER> . 

The pastor , who is known for making blunt statements about religion and politics , aimed his comments at <MISC> Republican </MISC> candidate <PER> Mitt Romney </PER> , a Mormon who had avoided discussions of religion in the race until <PER> Jeffress </PER> made his comments to reporters at the Values Voters Summit in <LOC> Washington </LOC> . 

<PER> Perry </PER> , an evangelical <MISC> Christian </MISC> , rejected the comments by <PER> Jeffress </PER> and said he did not believe Mormons were a cult . 

<PER> Jon Huntsman </PER> , former governor of <LOC> Utah </LOC> and another <MISC> Republican </MISC> presidential candidate , is also a Mormon . 

On Sunday , politicians bashed his comments on morning talk shows , and no one in the <MISC> Republican </MISC> race would back him up 

¡° I am not running for theologian in chief , ¡± <PER> Herman Cain </PER> , a former pizza executive who is rising fast in polls , said on <ORG> CNN </ORG> ¡¯s 

I am not going to get into an analysis of Mormonism vs. Christianity . 

I ¡¯m not getting into that , ¡± said <PER> Cain </PER> , who said he was a lifelong <MISC> Christian </MISC> . 

But <PER> Jeffress </PER> remained defiant in his convictions on Sunday during and after his remarks at the pulpit . 

Absolutely , <PER> Mormonism </PER> is a false religion , ¡± he told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> after the service . 

It was invented 1800 years after the establishment of Christianity . 

<PER> Jeffress </PER> , who earned degrees at <LOC> Baylor University </LOC> in <LOC> Waco </LOC> and the <LOC> Dallas Theological Seminary </LOC> , said he has known <PER> Perry </PER> personally for several years , but that they are not close . 

Local media reports have said he took part in at least one meeting of religious and political leaders , including <PER> Perry </PER> , during the summer when the <LOC> Texas </LOC> governor was still thinking about a presidential run . 

But there is no evidence that he is a close spiritual advisor to the governor . 

¡° We are not hunting buddies , ¡± he said . 

I am not the <PER> Jeremiah Wright </PER> of the right . ¡± 

President Barack Obama cut ties with <PER> Wright </PER> , his former pastor , after the church leader made what were attacked as anti - <MISC> American </MISC> remarks during the 2008 presidential campaign . 

<PER> Jeffress </PER> told his congregation that he decided as a private citizen to endorse <PER> Perry </PER> to ¡° push back against the evil that is engulfing our country , ¡± earning a standing ovation from the crowd at the downtown church . 

In spite of Jeffress¡¯ attempts to distance himself from <PER> Perry </PER> , pointing out that the remarks were not made during his introduction or in his endorsement , they have brought more negative attention to <PER> Perry </PER> ¡¯s struggling campaign . 

<PER> Jeffress </PER> , whose church boasts 10,000 members in a congregation that at one point included the Rev. <PER> Billy Graham </PER> , is an outspoken preacher who says he ¡¯s made more than 600 appearances nationally , and who hosts both a TV show and a daily radio program in addition to writing 17 books . 

In the past , <PER> effress </PER> has said that <MISC> Islam </MISC> is a false religion and that <PER> Oprah Winfrey </PER> is doing the work of Satan . 

I ¡¯m not some radical fringe person , ¡± he said on Sunday , adding that the Southern Baptist Convention has long held the position that <PER> Mormonism </PER> is not Christianity . 

He ¡¯s getting what he thinks from the Bible , and that ¡¯s where we need to go , ¡± said <PER> Kathy Waite </PER> , a congregation member who on Sunday said she has attended the church since 1944 .

Elevated audit fees can be a red flag of problems to come for a company , say three recent academic studies that together warn about increased chances of fraud , stock price declines or financial restatements . 

Companies have been disclosing how much they pay their auditors since 2001 , when the <ORG> Securities and Exchange Commission </ORG> instituted the requirement as part of a push to improve corporate auditor independence . 

The numbers may be underappreciated by investors , however , who seem not to recognize the special insights auditors have . 

The auditors have private information about the firm because of their interaction with management . 

They obviously have a lot of risk associated with any fraud at a firm , and we assume they adjust their fee accordingly , ¡± said <PER> Ryan Wilson </PER> , who teaches accounting at the <ORG> Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa </ORG> , in an interview October 5 . 

He co - authored an April 2010 study on the topic . 

A high or rising audit fee can indicate one of two things , experts say . 

Either the auditor is charging a risk premium , aiming to cover future legal costs to them of something going awry , or they may just be doing more work on the audit , digging into areas where results are uncertain . 

The studies¡¯ findings come at a moment when regulators are considering requiring auditors to give out even more information . 

A proposal under consideration by the <ORG> U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board </ORG> might have auditors disclosing more than the current minimal thumbs up or down . 

Meantime , their fees seem to be telling a valuable story . 

Audit fees substantially above those paid by competitors and companies of similar size are strongly associated with a slip in operating performance the following year , and to a lesser degree as many as five years later , according to research by <PER> Jonathan Stanley </PER> , an accounting professor at <ORG> Auburn University </ORG> , published in the current August / October issue of Auditing , a journal of the <ORG> American Accounting Association </ORG> . 

In addition to forecasting operating declines , high audit fees are predictive of fraud and restatements , and rising fees can foreshadow steep stock price drops , credit rating downgrades and class action lawsuits , the research has found . 

<ORG> American International Group Inc </ORG> , the insurance giant bailed out by the government on the brink of bankruptcy in 2008 , is one of a number of examples cited in interviews with the authors of the studies . 

According to <ORG> SEC </ORG> filings , AIG paid $ 66 million for its 2004 audit , a $ 33 million increase over its 2003 fee . 

In 2005 , the company restated its 2000 , 2001 , 2002 and 2003 numbers . 

Another example is <MISC> Swedish </MISC> mobile phone maker <ORG> Ericsson </ORG> . 

<PER> Nicole Thorne </PER> Jenkins of <ORG> Vanderbilt University ¡¯s Owen Graduate School of Management </ORG> said the fees climbed significantly faster than peers¡¯ the year before it issued a 36 percent profit decline in 2007 that sent its stock down sharply . 

A 2004 sales shortfall at technology group <ORG> Altera Corp </ORG> was preceded by a rise in its audit fee . 

<ORG> PricewaterhouseCoopers </ORG> , the auditor of all three companies , declined to comment citing a policy of not discussing client matters . 

<PER> Jenkins </PER> said in an October 5 interview that her research published April 2011 found investors as a group do not recognize the importance of audit fees . 

<ORG> Auburn ¡¯s Stanley </ORG> said investors should consider audit fees with other metrics like short interest and analysts¡¯ forecasts , in an October 5 interview . 

There ¡¯s a link between audit price and future performance , ¡± he said . 

Unusually low fees may be worth keeping an eye on too , argued <PER> Donald Whalen </PER> , director of research for <ORG> Audit Analytics </ORG> , in an October 6 interview . 

If audit fees are way down , how can the auditor be performing the necessary work ? 

<PER> Whalen </PER> highlighted the case of government - backed loan purchaser <ORG> Fannie Mae </ORG> . 

<ORG> Auditor KPMG </ORG> charged the lender less than $ 3 million a year in 2001 , 2002 and 2003 . 

When the company changed auditors in 2004 , hiring <ORG> Deloitte & Touche </ORG> , the fees went up sharply to a dramatic $ 203 million in 2004 . 

Fees have since dropped , but at $ 37 million for the 2010 audit , they remain well above KPMG ¡¯s price . 

<ORG> Fannie Mae ¡¯s regulator </ORG> , the <ORG> Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight </ORG> , raised questions about the company ¡¯s accounting in 2004 , after which its stock dropped sharply . 

The company eventually restated 2001 - 2004 earnings , erasing $ 6.3 billion of reported income .

After a poor start to the fourth quarter , investors¡¯ mood may be just starting to stabilize after moves by <MISC> European </MISC> policymakers to help fragile banks and avert a financial meltdown . 

But it may take a lot grander plan to truly kick start a risk rally . 

The coming week ¡ª packed again with heavy political and economic events ¡ª may provide a key insight into what kind of initiatives policymakers are planning to implement to stave off recession and contain the effect of a possible <MISC> Greek </MISC> default . 

World stocks , measured by <ORG> MSCI </ORG> .MIWD00000PUS , rebounded 8 percent after hitting a 15-month low earlier in the week and are on track to post their second weekly gain . 

This , to an extent , bodes well as the fourth quarter has been the best period for equities since 1971 , with stocks rising on average 3.7 percent in the period . 

What has bolstered the market was some policy moves . 

The <ORG> Bank of England </ORG> surprised investors on Thursday by launching a second round of quantitative easing , pledging to buy a bigger - than - expected 75 billion pounds of assets with new money . 

The <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> followed up with aggressive liquidity measures , throwing a lifeline to cash - strained lenders . 

The <ORG> European Union </ORG> also said it would present a plan for a coordinated recapitalization of banks by member states . 

For many investors , who have already moved to a defensive strategy of underweight equities and overweight bonds , it would require a ¡° shock and awe ¡± development to turn their mood around . 

¡° You will probably need 2 - 3 trillion euros to frighten the market . 

We are positioned as if the <MISC> euro </MISC> will break up ¡ª underweight periphery , banks and <MISC> euro </MISC> . 

We do n¡¯t think it will happen but the market pain could be as hard , ¡± said <PER> Carl Astorri </PER> , global head of economics and asset strategy at <ORG> Coutts </ORG> . 

¡° Sixty percent of the world GDP is deleveraging , which slows down growth . 

That ¡¯s a long process , just as credit bubbles took time to build .

Over the weekend , <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicholas Sarkozy </PER> is meeting head of IMF <PER> Christine Lagarde </PER> , before moving to <LOC> Berlin </LOC> to meet <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> where they are likely to discuss bank recapitalization .

A source told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> the <ORG> European Commission </ORG> is expected to present a proposal on bank recapitalization before the <ORG> EU </ORG> leaders summit on Oct 17 . 

<ORG> Credit Suisse </ORG> said it would revise its underweight position of <MISC> continental European </MISC> stocks if it saw an additional package worth at least 1 - 1.5 trillion euros , equivalent to 40 percent of outstanding debt in the peripheral <MISC> euro </MISC> zone countries . 

Within this , Credit <ORG> Suisse </ORG> reckons <MISC> European </MISC> governments should spend 300 - 400 million euros to recapitalize banks . 

It also said a weaker <MISC> euro </MISC> needs to be part of the solution of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone problems , given each 10 percent decline in the <MISC> euro </MISC> adds 0.7 percent to <MISC> European </MISC> GDP growth . 

Following <MISC> European </MISC> steps , there is a tentative sign that strains on money markets and banks are starting to ease . 

The three - month EURIBOR - OIS spread is down nearly 10 basis points this week to 74 bps , its lowest in a month . 

In the FX swaps market , the premium for swapping <MISC> euro </MISC> LIBOR into dollar LIBOR over three months ¡ª known as the cross currency swap ¡ª eased to around 102 bps , off a September high around 123 bps . 

Earlier in the year , <MISC> European </MISC> banks needing funds were forced to turn to FX forwards and swaps , causing a sharp widening of the dollar premium in FX swaps , especially in <MISC> euro </MISC> and yen markets . 

A credit default swap index based on 25 <MISC> European </MISC> financials fell to 252.56 bps , down nearly 19 percent from a September peak . 

<ORG> JP Morgan </ORG> said an issuance of unsecured bonds by <ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> and <ORG> ABN Amro </ORG> late in September worth 2 billion euros following a three - month freeze presented an important step for <MISC> European </MISC> debt markets . 

¡° Coupled with ( upcoming ECB funding operations ) , it is likely that bank bond issuance will improve further over the coming weeks , boosting confidence in credit markets , ¡± it said . 

And confidence in the credit market is essential for a broader risk asset market . 

¡° The key thing to watch is the corporate credit and government bond market , which is much better at judging what ¡¯s going to happen than equity markets , ¡± <PER> Astorri </PER> said . 

* <ORG> Hellenic Petroleum </ORG> workers to start walkout on Tuesday 

* Employees at electricity utility <ORG> PPC </ORG> may follow suit 

* Workers oppose planned wage caps as part of public - sector reform 

<LOC> ATHENS </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> Greek </MISC> petroleum and electricity workers threatened late on Sunday to go on strike , to oppose planned wage cuts that form part of the debt - laden country ¡¯s austerity drive . 

Workers at the country ¡¯s biggest <ORG> refiner Hellenic Petroleum </ORG> said they would start a walkout on Tuesday , demanding their exclusion from the provisions of a draft law which would cap their company ¡¯s average wage cost per employee at 1,900 euros ( $ 2,563 ) a month . 

The cap was originally meant to apply just to civil servants , as part of spending cuts imposed by the <ORG> EU </ORG> and the IMF under the cash - strapped country ¡¯s ongoing bailout programme . 

But a last - minute change in the bill , which was submitted to parliament last week , it also included in its remit profitable , state - controlled companies that are listed on the <ORG> stock exchange </ORG> , such as <ORG> Hellenic Petroleum </ORG> . 

By late Wednesday all the company ¡¯s three refiners will have ground to a halt , ¡± <ORG> Hellenic ¡¯s labour union </ORG> leader <PER> Panagiotis Ofthalmides </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

Public discontent is rising in <LOC> Greece </LOC> as the government is taking ever harsher austerity measures to compensate for fiscal slippages which threaten to derail the country ¡¯s <ORG> EU </ORG> / IMF - led rescue and plunge it into bankruptcy . 

Workers at the dominant electricity producer <ORG> PPC </ORG> 

also vowed to oppose the law . 

¡° <ORG> PPC </ORG> workers suffered in 2010 average pay cuts of between 15 and 50 percent ... 

we wo n¡¯t allow the destruction of our families , ¡± their <ORG> GENOP labour union </ORG> said in a press release . 

<PER> GENOP </PER> will decide later on Monday how exactly it will oppose the law , saying ¡° it will use all available means of struggle ¡± . 

If lawmakers approve the law in its current form , the cap would also apply to a string of other listed companies such as the country ¡¯s two biggest water utilities <LOC> Athens </LOC> Water 

and <LOC> Thessaloniki </LOC> Water . 

<LOC> Greece </LOC> is expected to sell stakes in the state controlled companies as part of a privatisation drive that also forms part of its debt - fighting plans .

<LOC> BRUSSELS </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <PER> Franco </PER> - <MISC> Belgian </MISC> bank <ORG> Dexia </ORG> was set to be broken up and partly nationalised after being slammed by a funding squeeze in the latest warning sign about the health of <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s struggling lenders . 

The rescue of <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , which has global credit risk exposure of $ 700 billion ¡ª more than twice <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s GDP ¡ª came as the leaders of <MISC> French </MISC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> agreed in a joint press conference that <MISC> European </MISC> banks needed to be recapitalised , but papered over differences on how that would happen . 

Details of the rescue were not revealed while <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s board met in <LOC> Brussels </LOC> to approve the plan , but it will call for the bank ¡¯s <MISC> Belgian </MISC> retail unit and <MISC> French </MISC> municipal finance operations to come under government control . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> was forced to seek state help for the second time in three years after a liquidity crunch hobbled the lender and sent its shares down 42 percent over the past week . 

<MISC> French </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Francois Fillon </PER> , his <MISC> Belgian </MISC> counterpart <PER> Yves Leterme </PER> and <PER> Luc Frieden </PER> , the finance minister of <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> , where <ORG> Dexia </ORG> has a large presence , had found a solution for the stricken Franco - <MISC> Belgian </MISC> bank , <PER> Leterme </PER> ¡¯s office said early Sunday afternoon . 

The three governments have agreed to put a proposal to the board which fits completely with the goals of the <MISC> Belgian </MISC> government , which means to take over <ORG> Dexia </ORG> Bank <LOC> Belgium </LOC> , secure it and turn it into a very safe bank , ¡± <PER> Leterme </PER> said after two hours of talks at <LOC> Egmont Palace </LOC> in <LOC> Brussels </LOC> ¡ª also the site of negotiations for a previous <ORG> Dexia </ORG> rescue in 2008 . 

At stake in the talks is how much each government will have to contribute to help wind down <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , a thorny subject given that <LOC> Belgium </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> are already struggling to contain large deficits . 

The need to recapitalise banks is emerging as another strain for <MISC> European </MISC> governments whose budgets are already stretched . 

<LOC> Belgium </LOC> had a debt - to - gross domestic product ratio of 96.2 percent last year , lower only than <LOC> Greece </LOC> and <LOC> Italy </LOC> among <MISC> euro </MISC> zone members and on a par with bailout recipient <LOC> Ireland </LOC> . 

I am convinced that it is possible ... by tomorrow morning to have an agreement in which <LOC> Belgium </LOC> resolves the issue without pushing up the debt level of our country too high , ¡± <PER> Leterme </PER> told <MISC> Belgian </MISC> television before Sunday ¡¯s talks . 

The burden of bailing out <ORG> Dexia </ORG> led ratings agency <ORG> Moody ¡¯s </ORG> to warn <LOC> Belgium </LOC> late on Friday that its Aa1 government bond ratings may fall . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> , which used short - term funding to finance long - term lendings , has found credit drying up as the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis worsened . 

This problem has been exacerbated by the bank ¡¯s heavy exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s near collapse stoked investors¡¯ anxieties about the strength of <MISC> European </MISC> banks and coincided with growing talk about coordinated <ORG> EU </ORG> action to recapitalise banks across the continent . 

<LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> have so far been split over how to recapitalise shaky <MISC> European </MISC> banks . 

<LOC> Paris </LOC> wants to tap the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s 440 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> ( $ 594 billion ) 

<ORG> European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> ( <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) to recapitalise <MISC> French </MISC> banks , while <LOC> Berlin </LOC> is insisting the fund should be used as a last resort . 

There were fresh reports over the weekend that <LOC> France </LOC> ¡¯s top banks <ORG> BNP Paribas </ORG> and <ORG> Societe Generale </ORG> could agree to capital injections as part of a <LOC> Europe </LOC> - wide plan to boost lenders¡¯ financial strength , although both banks continue to deny such plans . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s overhaul will likely see its <MISC> French </MISC> municipal financing arm split from the group and merged with <MISC> French </MISC> state bank <ORG> Caisse des Depots </ORG> and <ORG> Banque Postale </ORG> , the <ORG> French post office ¡¯s banking arm </ORG> . 

The <MISC> Belgian </MISC> government will nationalise <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s largely retail banking business in <LOC> Belgium </LOC> . 

Media reports said it would have to pay 4 billion euros to do so . 

Healthy units , such as Denizbank in <LOC> Turkey </LOC> , will be sold . 

A ¡® bad bank¡¯ supported by state guarantees will hold 95 billion euros in bonds , including 12 billion euros of sovereign debt of weaker <MISC> euro </MISC> zone periphery nations . 

Including 7 billion euros of securities linked to <LOC> U.S. </LOC> mortgages , <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Belgium </LOC> may need to provide guarantees to cover up to 200 billion euros of assets , which would be more than 55 percent of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> GDP . 

<LOC> Belgium </LOC> , under an agreement reached between the governments on Sunday , will guarantee 60 percent of the bad assets while <LOC> France </LOC> will be responsible for most of the rest , sources familiar with the talks said . 

The key issues are how to divide up the ¡® bad bank¡¯ asset guarantees , how much <LOC> Belgium </LOC> should pay to nationalise <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s <MISC> Belgian </MISC> banking business and whether others , such as <LOC> Belgium </LOC> ¡¯s regions , would be involved in its purchase . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s shares have been suspended since Thursday afternoon .

An unusual number of potential awards movies have yet to be seen , but that does n't mean studios have n't released some glimpses of " War Horse " and " <PER> J. Edgar </PER> " and " The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo " and others . 

In fact , the past week brought several such marketing goodies . 

The " <PER> J. Edgar </PER> " poster ( left ) , with its image of <PER> Leonardo DiCaprio </PER> 's <PER> J. Edgar Hoover </PER> , his face contorted in rage , is one example . 

<PER> Jason Reitman </PER> 's " Young Adult " ¡ª 

which bypassed the filmmaker 's typical <LOC> Toronto </LOC> debut ¡ª will be released in December in the same slot that Paramount successfully used last year for " The Fighter . " 

The film stars <PER> Charlize Theron </PER> as a successful writer who returns to her hometown to try to win back her now - married high school sweetheart . 

Judging from the trailer , <PER> Theron </PER> 's character is unpleasant , <PER> Diablo Cody </PER> 's dialogue is as smart - alecky as ever and <PER> Patton Oswalt </PER> has the semi - loveable sidekick role . 

<PER> Steven Spielberg </PER> 's " War Horse , " 

which sight unseen has topped some Oscar - watchers ' polls , released a second trailer ¡ª which , like the first , is long on stirring romantic music , sweeping shots and , on occasion , that patented Spielbergian rosy glow , this time suffusing a horse in World War I rather than an alien in suburbia . 

We 'll have to wait before answering that one . 

In <LOC> Europe </LOC> , <PER> Spielberg </PER> 's other 

2011 movie will bow well before " War Horse . " 

" The Adventures of Tintin " will be released in October in the <LOC> UK </LOC> , with a new <MISC> European </MISC> trailer dropping this past week . 

The film , which was made using performance - capture technology ¡ª and which is looking to be classified as an animated feature by the Academy ¡ª looks like a cartoon at some points in the trailer and an <LOC> Indiana Jones </LOC> movie at other points . 

The action happens too fast to really ascertain if <PER> Spielberg </PER> has solved the infamous problem of dead eyes in motion capture characters . 

<PER> Clint Eastwood </PER> 's biopic " <PER> J. Edgar </PER> " released its own trailer a couple of weeks ago , after which pundits hurried to judge <PER> DiCaprio </PER> 's awards worthiness on the basis of a handful of snippets that may or may not accurately capture his entire performance . 

<ORG> Warner Bros. </ORG> has followed with two posters for the film , above and to the right . 

The image in both is the same : a profile shot of <PER> DiCaprio </PER> as a very angry and thoroughly unpleasant - looking <PER> J. Edgar Hoover </PER> , with the caption ( too small to read in these reproductions ) " 

The most powerful man in the world . " 

One wonders how hard the film will have to work to justify that hyperbole . 

Shame , " the sexually explicit drama due for a December 2 release from <PER> Fox Searchlight </PER> . 

While the film quickly became famous in festival circles for its full - frontal nudity from stars <PER> Michael Fassbender </PER> and <PER> Carey Mulligan </PER> , the poster takes the opposite tack : it does n't feature any skin at all . 

But the implications of its unmade bedsheets are pretty clear , and the image quite striking . 

Back on the trailer front , the <PER> Weinstein </PER> Company provided a first look at <PER> Michelle Williams </PER> ' reputedly <PER> Oscar </PER> - worthy performance as <PER> Marilyn Monroe </PER> in " My Week With <PER> Marilyn </PER> " just a few days before the film had its premiere at the <LOC> New York </LOC> Film Festival . 

It 's safe to say that everybody in the trailer is overshadowed by <PER> Williams </PER> ¡ª except maybe <PER> Judi Dench </PER> , who only needs a line or two to be memorable . 

Finally , <PER> David Fincher </PER> 's " The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo " got another trailer to follow its initial teaser , and the eight - minute assemblage released almost a month ago . 

Like its predecessors , the new trailer is cold and stylish and striking . 

And as that trailer hit , so did a series of photos of " Dragon Tattoo " star <PER> Rooney Mara </PER> taken by photographer <PER> Jean </PER> - <PER> Baptiste Mondino </PER> for the <MISC> French </MISC> fashion magazine <ORG> Le Monde </ORG> .

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s overhaul will likely see its <MISC> French </MISC> municipal financing arm split from the group and merged with <MISC> French </MISC> state bank <ORG> Caisse des Depots </ORG> and <ORG> Banque Postale </ORG> , the <ORG> French post office ¡¯s banking arm </ORG> . 

The <MISC> Belgian </MISC> government will nationalise <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s largely retail banking business in <LOC> Belgium </LOC> . 

Media reports said it would have to pay 4 billion euros to do so . 

Healthy units , such as Denizbank in <LOC> Turkey </LOC> , will be sold . 

A ¡® bad bank¡¯ supported by state guarantees will hold 95 billion euros in bonds , including 12 billion euros of sovereign debt of weaker <MISC> euro </MISC> zone periphery nations . 

Including 7 billion euros of securities linked to <LOC> U.S. </LOC> mortgages , <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Belgium </LOC> may need to provide guarantees to cover up to 200 billion euros of assets , which would be more than 55 percent of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> GDP . 

<LOC> Belgium </LOC> , under an agreement reached between the governments on Sunday , will guarantee 60 percent of the bad assets while <LOC> France </LOC> will be responsible for most of the rest , sources familiar with the talks said . 

The key issues are how to divide up the ¡® bad bank¡¯ asset guarantees , how much <LOC> Belgium </LOC> should pay to nationalise <ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s <MISC> Belgian </MISC> banking business and whether others , such as <LOC> Belgium </LOC> ¡¯s regions , would be involved in its purchase . 

<ORG> Dexia </ORG> ¡¯s shares have been suspended since Thursday afternoon .

<LOC> Germany </LOC> ¡¯s markets regulator told <ORG> RHJ </ORG> that it believed the private equity house was unable to fund the deal and therefore needed to withdraw its application to buy <ORG> BHF </ORG> , one of the people familiar with the matter said . 

<ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> and <ORG> BaFin </ORG> declined to comment . 

<ORG> RHJ </ORG> was not immediately available for comment . 

<MISC> German </MISC> daily <ORG> Financial Times Deutschland </ORG> was first to report that <ORG> BaFin </ORG> had demanded the deal to be put on ice , according to an excerpt of its Monday edition . 

In July , <ORG> RHJ International </ORG> said it was in exclusive negotiations to acquire <ORG> BHF </ORG> , adding that it planned to finance the purchase with the <ORG> support of co </ORG> - investors . 

The costs of funding <ORG> BHF </ORG> once it is split from <ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> have risen due to strains in the <ORG> inter </ORG> - bank lending market , a factor that has deterred potential partners for co - investor <ORG> Kleinwort Benson </ORG> . 

<ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> has been on the lookout for a buyer ever since it inherited <ORG> BHF </ORG> through the 1 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> purchase of <ORG> Sal </ORG> . 

<ORG> Deutsche Bank </ORG> ¡¯s initial plan to sell <ORG> BHF </ORG> to <ORG> LGT </ORG> [ LGT.UL ] , owned by the <ORG> royal family of Liechtenstein </ORG> , was scuppered in April after the deal was blocked by <MISC> German </MISC> regulator <ORG> BaFin </ORG> .

The <ORG> Oakland Raiders </ORG> earned a dramatic victory that would have delighted late owner <PER> Al Davis </PER> as they beat the <ORG> Houston Texans </ORG> 25 - 20 on Sunday while the <ORG> New Orleans Saints </ORG> and <ORG> Buffalo </ORG> Bills moved to 4 - 1 records with wins in week five of the <MISC> National Football League </MISC> season . 

The outspoken <PER> Davis </PER> died at age 82 on Saturday but the <ORG> Raiders </ORG> , wearing ¡° <ORG> AL ¡± </ORG> stickers on their helmets , carried out his motto 

¡± as <PER> Michael Huff </PER> grabbed an interception off Texans quarterback <PER> Matt Schaub </PER> in the end zone on the final play . 

<ORG> Raiders </ORG> coach <PER> Hue Jackson </PER> buried his face in his hands on the sideline while players embraced each other as the emotional game ended . 

Once again <PER> Sebastian Janikowski </PER> was the spine of the win for the <ORG> Raiders </ORG> ( 3 - 2 ) , kicking four field goals , three of them from 50 yards or more . 

<PER> Arian Foster </PER> put up some big numbers for the Texans with 116 yards receiving and 68 yards rushing , but <ORG> Houston </ORG> missed injured receiver <PER> Andre Johnson </PER> who was sidelined with a hamstring injury . 

The <ORG> Carolina Panthers </ORG> , with rookie <PER> quarterback Cam Newton </PER> scoring three touchdowns ( one rushing ) and passing for 224 yards , pushed the Saints all the way before losing 30 - 27 . 

A <PER> Greg Olsen </PER> touchdown on a five - yard <PER> Newton </PER> pass put <LOC> Carolina </LOC> up 27 - 23 in the fourth but <LOC> New Orleans </LOC> came back with <PER> Drew Brees </PER> finding <PER> Pierre Thomas open </PER> on the right for the winning touchdown . 

Despite another encouraging display , the <ORG> Panthers </ORG> , who won just twice last year , fall to 1 - 4 . 

The <LOC> Buffalo </LOC> Bills¡¯ impressive start continued as they took advantage of four interceptions by <ORG> Philadelphia Eagles </ORG> quarterback <PER> Michael Vick </PER> in a 31 - 24 win . 

<PER> Fred Jackson </PER> rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown for the Bills and also had 85 yards receiving against an <ORG> Eagles </ORG> team ( 1 - 4 ) that , after being considered Super Bowl contenders in the pre - season , have now suffered four consecutive defeats . 

In one of Sunday ¡¯s surprise results , the <ORG> Seattle Seahawks </ORG> enjoyed a 36 - 25 win at the <ORG> New York Giants </ORG> . 

Backup quarterback <PER> Charlie Whitehurst </PER> put <ORG> Seattle </ORG> ahead with a 27-yard touchdown pass to <PER> Doug Baldwin </PER> before <PER> Brandon Browner </PER> grabbed an interception on a pass tip and ran 94 yards for a score that put the game beyond the <ORG> Giants </ORG> . 

<ORG> Giants </ORG> quarterback <PER> Eli Manning </PER> threw for 420 yards and three touchdowns but also had three interceptions . 

The <ORG> Minnesota Vikings </ORG> got their first win of the season , in some style , with running back <PER> Adrian Peterson </PER> rushing for three touchdowns in the first quarter against <LOC> Arizona </LOC> in a 34 - 10 victory . 

There is still no victory for the <ORG> Indianapolis Colts </ORG> who have been without quarterback <PER> Peyton Manning </PER> all season and were beaten 28 - 24 by the <LOC> Kansas City </LOC> Chiefs . 

<PER> Matt Cassel </PER> threw for four touchdowns and 257 yards as the Chiefs scored 21 points unanswered to wipe out a good first half from the <ORG> Colts </ORG> and their stand - in quarterback <PER> Curtis Painter </PER> .

Moderate left - wing candidate <PER> Francois Hollande </PER> led in a primary vote for the <MISC> French </MISC> Socialist Party ¡¯s presidential nomination on Sunday , bolstering his position as the favorite to unseat conservative President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> in April . 

More than two million people voted in <LOC> France </LOC> ¡¯s first <LOC> U.S </LOC> .- style primary election to select a presidential candidate , which the Socialists say was inspired by the process that gave Barack Obama the momentum to take the <LOC> White House </LOC> . 

The <ORG> Socialist Party </ORG> published preliminary results showing <PER> Hollande </PER> in front with 39 percent of votes , short of an absolute majority and therefore headed for a runoff on October 16 . 

He will face <PER> Martine Aubry </PER> , a one - time labor minister and daughter of former <ORG> European Commission </ORG> president <PER> Jacques Delors </PER> . 

She won 31 percent in the preliminary readout . 

Opinion polls have predicted that <PER> Hollande </PER> , a witty if unexciting party veteran who has never been a government minister , would not only win the Socialist primary but would defeat <PER> Sarkozy </PER> by a comfortable margin if the two face off in the presidential battle next April . 

That would make him the first Socialist leader in the Elysee Palace for 17 years . 

The contenders and <ORG> Socialist Party </ORG> chief <PER> Harlem Desir </PER> described the turnout on a drizzly day across much of the country as a triumph for democracy , the party and its future presidential candidate . 

Previous primaries were closed - shop events , limited to about 200,000 party members in a country of more than 65 million . 

time , any registered voter who paid a <MISC> euro </MISC> ( $ 1.35 ) and professed to support left - wing values could participate . 

¡° It ¡¯s not expensive to get rid of <PER> Sarkozy </PER> , ¡± <PER> Hollande </PER> said before Sunday ¡¯s ballot , where he competed with five others including <PER> Aubry </PER> and <PER> Segolene Royal </PER> , his former partner and mother of his four children . 

After Sunday ¡¯s results , <PER> Hollande </PER> appealed to all voters to back him in the October 16 runoff . 

The winning candidate will have the job of beating the right and sidelining the far right . 

As of today I am in a position to meet that challenge , ¡± he told supporters in <LOC> Paris </LOC> . 

¡° Do what it takes so that when the second round is over I will be the candidate who allows <LOC> France </LOC> to recover confidence in itself , ¡± he added . 

<PER> Aubry </PER> too flexed her muscles for the final duel , speaking to supporters after the other four contenders conceded defeat . 

¡° I will unite all those who want this change and beat <PER> Sarkozy </PER> in 2012 , ¡± she said . 

The Socialists were deprived of a potentially strong candidate this year when <PER> Dominique Strauss </PER> - <PER> Kahn </PER> resigned his post as head of the <ORG> International Monetary Fund </ORG> after being charged with a sex assault in <LOC> New York </LOC> . 

The charges were later dropped , but <PER> Strauss </PER> - <PER> Kahn </PER> ¡¯s political career has not recovered . 

<PER> Hollande </PER> ¡¯s closest rival has always been <PER> Aubry </PER> , minister from 1997 to 2002 when a left - wing government last held office . 

In one surprise , the preliminary results showed anti - globalisation contender <PER> Arnaud Montebourg </PER> in third place with about 17 percent of votes . 

Royal , who lost the 2007 presidential election to <PER> Sarkozy </PER> , had been expected to place third but sank to a score of seven percent . 

The final results were not expected before 0930 <MISC> GMT </MISC> on Monday at the earliest , said <PER> Jean </PER> - <PER> Pierre Mignard </PER> , a spokesman for the body in charge of overseeing the ballot . 

There had been no reports of voting irregularities and no complaints late into Sunday , he added . 

The novelty of the primary contest may give the Socialists a boost if , in addition to the healthy turnout , it produces a clear - cut winner , political analysts say . 

Millions have tuned into live television debates between the Socialist candidates in the past three weeks as the primary appeared to capture the popular imagination . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> ¡¯s <ORG> UMP party </ORG> , which criticised the Socialists¡¯ motives for the innovation at the outset , is considering doing the same , not in time for the upcoming presidential election but the one after it , says Prime Minister <PER> Francois Fillon </PER> . 

In opinion polls , <PER> Sarkozy </PER> remains deeply unpopular and voters are ready to see the left take power . 

Parliamentary elections will be held on the heels of the presidential election , with a first ballot on April 22 and run - off on May 6 . 

Socialist primary sparred on occasion , <PER> Hollande </PER> and <PER> Aubry </PER> have often been accused of not being very different on policy even if , on style , <PER> Aubry </PER> comes across as slightly more old - <PER> schhol </PER> left that <PER> Hollande </PER> . 

Their party manifesto established the basic thrust of their policy , which is to repeal 50 billion euros of tax breaks introduced under <PER> Sarkozy </PER> , using half of that money to cut the deficit and the other half to promote jobs and economic growth .

<PER> Moses Mosop </PER> of <LOC> Kenya </LOC> set a course record in cruising to victory in the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon on Sunday in a race tempered by the first death in the event in four years after a runner collapsed near the finish line . 

The male runner collapsed about 500 yards from the finish line and within 50 yards of doctors , who responded immediately , marathon spokeswoman <PER> Robin Monsky </PER> said . 

Five doctors worked to revive him but could not and the man was pronounced dead 1 hour and 45 minutes later at a local hospital , <PER> Monsky </PER> said . 

The <ORG> Cook County Medical Examiner ¡¯s Office </ORG> confirmed the runner ¡¯s death , but declined to release his identity or any other details . 

The last death in the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon occurred in 2007 , when temperatures climbed to 90 degrees F ( 32 C ) with high humidity . 

Some 300 runners were taken to hospital suffering from heat - related illness and the race was halted early . 

Conditions were milder this year with Sunday afternoon highs reaching only 73 degrees at a lake front gauge near <LOC> Grant Park </LOC> where the race started and finished , according to the <ORG> National Weather Service </ORG> . 

Marathon organizers reported transporting 54 individuals to area hospitals , down from 100 last year . 

Temperatures on the <LOC> Chicago lakefront </LOC> were in the mid-60s for the first two hours of the race and did not reach as high as expected through midday when the bulk of the runners were working their way through the city ¡¯s neighborhoods . 

Earlier in the day , Mosop surged away from an elite field of runners with seven miles to go , setting a course record of two hours five minutes and 37 seconds and waving to the crowd as he trotted toward the finish line . 

<PER> Liliya Shobukhova </PER> of <LOC> Russia </LOC> won the women ¡¯s competition for the third straight year in two hours eighteen minutes and 20 seconds , beating the second place women 

¡¯s finisher by nearly four minutes . 

Both winners¡¯ times were unofficial . 

<PER> Mosop </PER> , who had the second fastest marathon time on record in losing the <LOC> Boston </LOC> Marathon by 4 seconds earlier this year , quickly countered a breakaway by <PER> countryman Wesley Korir </PER> after the 19 mile mark and never looked back in breaking the course record set two years ago . 

<PER> Korir </PER> finished 38 seconds behind Mosop in second place . 

<PER> Bernard Kipyego </PER> of <LOC> Kenya </LOC> was third . 

In a post - race interview , <PER> Mosop </PER> said he had been prepared to challenge for a course record , but not the world record because a leg injury had limited his training . 

I ¡¯m very happy about my job today , ¡± <PER> Mosop </PER> said in the interview on <ORG> NBC </ORG> television , which carried the race . 

<PER> Ryan Hall </PER> , a pre - race favorite , finished fifth overall in 2:08:04 and was the top <MISC> American </MISC> . 

<PER> Hall </PER> ¡¯s was the third fastest <MISC> American </MISC> performance on record for the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon trailing only <PER> Khalid Khannouchi </PER> ¡¯s two wins in 2002 and 2000 . 

The <LOC> Chicago </LOC> marathon course is considered ideal for record - setting performances when conditions are right . 

The route cuts through two dozen ethnic neighborhoods between its start and finish in <LOC> Grant Park </LOC> adjacent to downtown . 

<ORG> Mosop </ORG> had the second fastest marathon in history in <LOC> Boston </LOC> at <LOC> 2:03:06 </LOC> , just behind <PER> Geoffrey Mutai </PER> of <LOC> Kenya </LOC> who set the marathon record at 2:03:02 . 

Partly because <LOC> Boston </LOC> is a point - to - point course and there was a strong tailwind , those times were not recognized as world records . 

The current world record in the marathon is 2:03:38 , set September 25 in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> by <LOC> Kenya </LOC> ¡¯s <PER> Patrick Makau </PER> . 

<PER> Shobukhova </PER> had the second fastest time ever for a woman in the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon behind <PER> Paula Radcliffe </PER> of Great <LOC> Britain </LOC> who set a then - world record of 2:17:18 in 2002 . 

<MISC> Ethiopian </MISC> track star <PER> Ejegayehu Dibaba </PER> , who was making her marathon debut , ran alongside <PER> Shobukhova </PER> until about the 15 mile mark before slipping off the pace . 

Some 45,000 runners were registered for the race with more than 100 countries represented . 

Race organizers expected some 1.7 million spectators to watch along the route . 

About 35,600 runners were listed as finishing the race as of 4:30 p.m.

* <ORG> NTC </ORG> forces attack <ORG> Gaddafi security </ORG> HQ in central <LOC> Sirte </LOC> 

* <ORG> Gaddafi </ORG> forces putting up fierce resistance 

( New story ) 

<MISC> Libyan </MISC> transitional government forces attacked deposed leader <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> ¡¯s security headquarters in the centre of his hometown of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , hoping that once the buildings had been captured the fight for the city would be won . 

The protracted battle for <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , a showpiece Mediterranean coastal city largely loyal to <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> , has led to concerns the many civilian casualties will breed long - term hostility that will make it very hard for the <ORG> National Transitional Council </ORG> ( <ORG> NTC </ORG> ) to unite the country once the fighting is over . 

<ORG> NTC </ORG> forces have repeatedly claimed to be on the point of victory in <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , only to suffer sudden reversals at the hands of a tenacious enemy fighting for its life , surrounded on three sides and with its back to the sea . 

But as night fell on Sunday , pick - up trucks mounted with anti - aircraft guns pounded the white security buildings on a tree - lined square with a fountain in the centre while infantry blasted away with AK-47s from behind a high concrete wall , <ORG> Reuters </ORG> witnesses said . 

One of the pick - up gunners was shot in the face , his gun rotating repeatedly on its axis as he fell dead to the ground . 

¡° We are now in the centre of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , ¡± 

Colonel <PER> Salam Al Shalmany </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> at the scene . 

They are in these buildings about half a kilometre from where we are . 

But advances by <ORG> NTC </ORG> forces have often proved fragile . 

Earlier on Sunday , a large group of fighters , approaching <LOC> Sirte </LOC> from the west and trying to pin down <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> loyalists against the sea , saw their advance suddenly collapse into a rout under heavy and accurate mortar bombardment . 

Their trademark pick - up trucks raced to the rear , some running on flat tyres . 

One man with arm and leg wounds frantically limped away from the carnage as commanders screamed over the radios for their troops to pull back . 

Soon seven fighters lay dead in a field hospital while dozens more were being treated for shrapnel wounds . 

Elsewhere in the city , grown rich on 42 years of Gaddafi largesse , troops and residents still loyal to the former leader launched counter attacks after losing three landmark buildings ¡ª the hospital , the university and the lavish <LOC> Ouagadougou </LOC> centre , built to host summits of foreign dignitaries . 

Despite the counter strikes , the buildings appeared to remain in <ORG> NTC </ORG> hands . 

But in just one field hospital to the east of the city , doctors said they had received 17 dead and 87 wounded in Sunday ¡¯s fighting . 

<ORG> NTC </ORG> chairman <PER> Abdel Jalil </PER> told a news conference in the capital <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> that his men had reached <LOC> Sirte </LOC> city centre and were combing the town for snipers . 

The only other major Gaddafi - held town , <PER> Bani Walid </PER> , in the desert to the south , was also under siege from no fewer than five sides , he said . 

¡° I think and I hope , with the help of <PER> God </PER> , the liberation of these two towns will be completed by the end of this week . 

The prolonged struggle to capture <LOC> Sirte </LOC> and the other few remaining bastions of pro - <PER> Gaddafi </PER> loyalists has delayed <ORG> NTC </ORG> efforts to set up effective government and restart oil production , the lifeblood of the <MISC> Libyan </MISC> economy . 

<LOC> Sirte </LOC> holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . 

He built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . 

Thousands of civilians have fled <LOC> Sirte </LOC> as fighting has intensified , describing increasingly desperate conditions for those still inside the seafront city . 

There is no electricity while drinking water and food are running out .

* Coalition party <ORG> SaS </ORG> wants tighter EFSF mandate , ESM opt - out 

* Leaders to hold last - ditch meeting on Monday 

* Parliament vote due on Oct. 11 , fate of government at stake 

By <PER> Martin Santa </PER> and <PER> Michael Winfrey </PER> 

<LOC> BRATISLAVA </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> ¡¯s coalition leaders meet on Monday in a last - ditch bid to reach agreement on widening the mandate of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s bailout fund before parliament votes on Tuesday . 

Only <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> and <LOC> Malta </LOC> have yet to approve extra powers for the <ORG> European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> ( <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) in its fight against the spiralling sovereign debt crisis , while the other 15 <MISC> euro </MISC> zone members are already debating longer - term measures . 

The <ORG> small liberal Freedom and Solidarity </ORG> ( <ORG> SaS </ORG> ) party argues that the zone ¡¯s second poorest member is being asked to pay more than its fair share , but says it is still open to negotiation . 

We will negotiate until the last minute , ¡± <PER> Richard Sulik </PER> , the parliamentary speaker and head of <ORG> SaS </ORG> , said in a TV debate on Sunday . 

All <MISC> euro </MISC> countries must give the green light to boost the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ¡¯s effective lending capacity to 440 billion euros ( $ 594 billion ) , and allow it to buy states¡¯ debt , recapitalise banks facing solvency troubles and provide precautionary credit lines . 

Both <LOC> Italy </LOC> and <LOC> Spain </LOC> were downgraded by the credit rating agency Fitch on Friday , underlining the urgency of measures designed on particular to shield other <MISC> euro </MISC> zone countries from <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s spiralling economic and debt crisis . 

Prime Minister <PER> Iveta Radicova </PER> can be sure of getting EFSF approval through the <MISC> Slovak </MISC> parliament eventually . 

But if <ORG> SaS </ORG> does not back her , she will have to rely on the opposition , who have demanded a cabinet reshuffle or a fresh election as the price for their support . 

<PER> Sulik </PER> says <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> should not have to pay for the mistakes of <LOC> Greece </LOC> and others who have overspent and overborrowed . 

He said the average <MISC> Slovak </MISC> would have to work 300 hours to pay for their EFSF contribution , against 120 hours for a <MISC> German </MISC> . 

¡° We are going to support countries like <LOC> Italy </LOC> via bond buys , we will be saving <MISC> French </MISC> banks holding billions in assets and our salary is the lowest in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone , ¡± <PER> Sulik </PER> said . 

The <ORG> SaS </ORG> says it will vote ¡® yes¡¯ to the <ORG> EFSF </ORG> only if <LOC> Slovakia </LOC> ¡¯s participation is restricted , and it stays out of the planned permanent rescue mechanism , the ESM . 

<PER> Sulik </PER> said on Sunday he was sticking by his demand for a body that would vote on each stage of <MISC> Slovak </MISC> EFSF participation . 

If <ORG> SaS </ORG> does block approval , <PER> Radicova </PER> may choose to tie a second ballot to a vote of confidence in the government . 

Or she could go straight to the centre - left opposition <ORG> Smer </ORG> party to secure its support in return for the government ¡¯s resignation . 

<PER> Radicova </PER> has said she will secure EFSF approval by Oct. 14 , so that <ORG> European Union </ORG> leaders can discuss it at a meeting that starts two days later . 

<ORG> SaS </ORG> ¡¯s popularity has risen slightly thanks to its stance on <LOC> Europe </LOC> , but polls suggest <MISC> Slovaks </MISC> , whose purchasing power and average salaries are far below those of the <MISC> Greeks </MISC> , are evenly split . 

¡± said <PER> Stefan Matolak </PER> , a 35-year - old sales manager in the northern <MISC> Slovak </MISC> town of <LOC> Stara Lubovna </LOC> . 

¡° We entered the <MISC> euro </MISC> thinking we ¡¯d be equal partners , but they ¡¯re living high on the hog , and we are n¡¯t . 

<ORG> CHICAGO </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <ORG> Mikey Welsh </ORG> , the former bass player for the <ORG> alternative rock band Weezer </ORG> , was found dead in a <LOC> Chicago </LOC> hotel , a police spokeswoman said on Sunday . 

Workers at the <MISC> Rafaello </MISC> Hotel found <MISC> Welsh </MISC> unresponsive and not breathing when they went to his room on Saturday afternoon after he failed to check out as scheduled , spokeswoman <PER> Laura Kubiak </PER> said . 

<MISC> Welsh </MISC> , 40 , who left the band a decade ago , had been in <LOC> Chicago </LOC> to attend <PER> Weezer </PER> ¡¯s appearance at RiotFest on Sunday night , a concert that will go on as scheduled , the band said on its website in notifying fans of his death . 

¡° As sad as it is to think about , we know <PER> Mikey </PER> would never want the rock stopped on his account ¡ª 

quite the contrary in fact , ¡± the band said . 

<MISC> Welsh </MISC> left the band in 2001 after a well - publicized nervous breakdown , resurfacing later as an artist and painter . 

His chapter in the Weezer story ... was vital , essential , wild , and amazing , ¡± the band said , calling him ¡° a unique talent , a deeply loving friend and father . ¡± 

<MISC> Welsh </MISC> said in a posting on his Facebook page earlier in October that he was looking forward to meeting up with the band in <LOC> Chicago </LOC> . 

The <ORG> Cook County Medical Examiner ¡¯s office </ORG> conducted an autopsy on Sunday and listed the preliminary results as pending toxicology tests . 

It sometimes takes two months for the results of toxicology tests . 

After moving ¡° How to Be a Gentleman ¡± from Thursday to the TV wasteland of Saturday night , <ORG> CBS </ORG> has also halted production on new episodes of the show . 

While it has n¡¯t been canceled , the show ¡¯s prospects do n¡¯t look good . 

Gentleman ¡± premiered on September 29 , earning lower ratings than the now - canceled ¡° $ # * ! 

For its sophomore episode Thursday , ¡° Gentleman ¡± slid seven percent , to a 2.5 rating/7 share in the coveted 18 - 49 demographic . 

The remaining seven episodes of the series will air Saturday nights between repeats of ¡° Two and a Half Men ¡± and ¡° CSI : <LOC> Miami </LOC> . 

¡° Rules of Engagement ¡± will move from Saturdays to ¡° Gentleman¡±¡®s highly desirable time slot of Thursdays at 8:30 , which follows the very successful ¡° Big Bang Theory . 

¡± will claim the time slot on October 20 ; a repeat of ¡° 

The Big Bang Theory ¡± will run in the time slot on October 13 . 

Always Sunny in <LOC> Philadelphia </LOC> ¡± vet <PER> David Hornsby </PER> , who stars with <PER> Kevin Dillon </PER> . 

It ¡¯s shocking , but movies are of secondary concern in ¡° Life Itself , ¡± film critic <PER> Roger Ebert </PER> ¡¯s new memoir . 

Yes , the book features anecdotes from years spent churning out reviews of classics such as ¡° <MISC> Bonnie and Clyde ¡± and ¡° Boyz ¡® N The Hood ¡± </MISC> and boasts amusing remembrances of film greats like the hard - drinking <PER> Lee Marvin </PER> and a ¡° damned if I care ¡± <PER> Robert Mitchum </PER> . 

But readers hoping for an in - the - trenches account from <LOC> Ebert ¡¯s </LOC> decades as one of the nation ¡¯s taste - makers will be disappointed . 

Instead , <LOC> America </LOC> ¡¯s most famous film critic offers an over - stocked tour through his early life as the only child of an electrician , his struggles with alcoholism , his love affair and eventual marriage to his wife , <PER> Chaz </PER> , and his battle with cancer ¡ª- a fight that robbed him of the ability to speak , eat and drink , while leaving him , in his own words , looking like ¡° the Phantom of the Opera . ¡± 

There are also odes to the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> - based fast food chain Steak ¡® N Shake , loving accounts of travel to foreign cities such as <LOC> London </LOC> and <LOC> Venice </LOC> , riffs on secular humanism , and a chronicle of lost virginity involving a prostitute in <LOC> South Africa </LOC> . 

Even boyhood dog <PER> Blackie </PER> gets a chapter . 

At the end of it , you ¡¯ll know more about Ebert than you do your closest friends , and that ¡¯s not always a good thing . 

Though the prose is crisp and the stories , like <ORG> Ebert ¡¯s best </ORG> reviews , glide effortlessly without ever calling attention to the writing , it ¡¯s hard to shake the feeling that some of what ¡¯s recounted could have benefited from the red pen and that the most interesting bits were left on the cutting - room floor . 

¡± is generous , witty , and warm - hearted , but it ¡¯s also a bit rudderless . 

<PER> Ebert </PER> ¡¯s unflinching account of his struggles with alcoholism is admirable , as is his dignity in coping with the surgeries that mangled his face and robbed him of his voice , but the book takes off when he describes his career critiquing movies . 

The emotional high point is not when he finally gives up the bottle or accepts his medical condition , but in his loving tribute to Gene Siskel , his co - anchor on a weekly <MISC> review series ¡° Siskel & Ebert </MISC> : 

The tall , relatively slender , and private Siskel , who died of a brain tumor in 1999 , was the physical and temperamental opposite of the squat , portly , and effusive <PER> Ebert </PER> . 

Yet the two shared an improbable on - screen chemistry that worked off - screen , too . 

Part of the fun of their pairing were the times when the two parted ways on a movie and would engage in full - throated debates about a film ¡¯s merits . 

That combativeness , <PER> Ebert writes </PER> , almost inspired a sitcom about two rival critics joined in a love / hate relationship , but both CBS and <ORG> Disney </ORG> ultimately took a pass on the pitch . 

Maybe the problem was that no one else could possibly understand how meaningless was the hate , how deep was the love , ¡± <PER> Ebert writes </PER> . 

Love forms the spine of <MISC> Ebert ¡¯s memoir ¡ª love </MISC> for his emotionally crippling mother , love for his former bar - mates and fellow newspaper hounds and love for <PER> Chaz </PER> , the woman who has been a guardian angel , fiercely protective of his business interests and his medical care . 

It also appears , in an all - too - brief account of what films <ORG> excite Ebert </ORG> , in which he recounts what makes a memorable film . 

He does n¡¯t have a precise formula , mixing in everything from the joyful physical movement that defines ¡° Singing in the Rain ¡± to the great dialogue that bubbles up during the first 30 minutes of ¡° White Men 

¡° When you go to the movies every day , it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever , more craven and cowardly , more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes instead of educating them , ¡± <PER> Ebert writes </PER> . 

Then you see something absolutely miraculous , and on your way out you look distracted , as if you had just experienced some kind of a vision . ¡± 

The leaders of <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> have promised to unveil new measures to solve the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis by the end of the month , as international pressure builds for bold steps from <LOC> Europe </LOC> to avert an economic backlash of global proportions . 

<MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> said after talks in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> on Sunday evening that their goal was to come up with a sustainable answer for <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s woes , agree how to recapitalise <MISC> European </MISC> banks and present a plan for accelerating economic coordination in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone by a G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> on November 3 - 4 . 

But they declined to reveal any details of their plan . 

As they met , <MISC> British </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> David Cameron </PER> urged them to take a ¡° big bazooka ¡± approach to the crisis , telling the Financial Times that <MISC> euro </MISC> zone leaders had to break their cycle of doing ¡° a bit too little , a bit too late . ¡± 

<PER> Merkel </PER> and <PER> Sarkozy </PER> were due to hold a working dinner after their news conference . 

¡° We are very conscious that <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> have a particular responsibility for stabilising the <MISC> euro </MISC> , ¡± <PER> Sarkozy </PER> said , standing next to <PER> Merkel </PER> . 

¡° We need to deliver a response that is sustainable and comprehensive . 

We have decided to provide this response by the end of the month because <LOC> Europe </LOC> must solve its problems by the G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> . 

Financial markets were hoping the meeting of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s top two leaders would produce a breakthrough , and the lack of concrete steps could hurt sentiment on Monday . 

It ¡¯s great to see <PER> Sarkozy </PER> and <PER> Merkel </PER> talking , but they have to come up with some firm conclusions on what needs to be done , ¡± said <PER> Chris Wheeler </PER> , an analyst at <ORG> Mediobanca </ORG> in <LOC> London </LOC> . 

¡° The end of the month is a long way away . 

There has to be some clarity on what we need and it ¡¯s not coming through . ¡± 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> will host the <LOC> Cannes summit </LOC> and is keen to deliver a big success that might bolster his chances of winning re - election in a presidential vote next year . 

The <MISC> French </MISC> leader said he and <PER> Merkel </PER> were in ¡° total agreement ¡± on the recapitalisation of <MISC> European </MISC> banks , even though officials in <LOC> Paris </LOC> and <LOC> Berlin </LOC> have made clear in recent days that the countries are far apart . 

Foreign leaders are looking on in horror at the squabbling , fearful the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone crisis could plunge their own economies back into recession . 

President Barack Obama on Thursday urged <LOC> Europe </LOC> to ¡° act fast , ¡± calling the crisis the largest obstacle to a recovery in the <LOC> United States </LOC> . 

<PER> Cameron </PER> , in an interview with the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> , pressed <MISC> euro </MISC> zone leaders to increase the firepower of their 440 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> rescue fund ¡ª 

the <ORG> European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> ( <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) 

¡ª and to remove all uncertainty about <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s economic future . 

The <MISC> British </MISC> leader said he had conveyed his concerns that the currency bloc was acting too cautiously to <PER> Merkel </PER> personally over the weekend . 

The implosion of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> lender <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , the first bank to fall victim to the two - year - old <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis , has added a sense of urgency to the talks . 

The prime ministers of <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Belgium </LOC> and the finance minister of <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> agreed a rescue plan for <ORG> Dexia </ORG> on Sunday . 

Other <MISC> French </MISC> banks have also come under intense pressure because of their exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> . 

A senior banker told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> in <LOC> Paris </LOC> that <MISC> French </MISC> politicians were worried that even an orderly <MISC> Greek </MISC> debt default could floor <MISC> French </MISC> banks and were pushing for action to bolster capital levels . 

<LOC> Paris </LOC> wants to tap the EFSF to shore up its banks , worried that pouring its own money into them could compromise its coveted triple - A credit rating . 

Officials in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> have made clear that they believe the fund should be used only as a last resort , when <MISC> euro </MISC> zone member states do n¡¯t have the means to support their banks on their own . 

Another area of contention is how to use a new , enhanced EFSF to buy sovereign debt ¡ª an issue that would become particularly crucial if <LOC> Greece </LOC> failed to secure a new aid tranche . 

<LOC> Athens </LOC> is expected to run out of cash as soon as mid - November . 

Inspectors from the <ORG> European Commission </ORG> , the IMF and the <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> ¡ª the so - called <ORG> ¡° troika </ORG> 

¡± ¡ª are currently assessing whether the country has fulfilled the criteria for more aid . 

<LOC> Greece </LOC> has repeatedly failed to meet fiscal targets set out for it by the troika and its economy has performed far worse than predicted . 

In addition to addressing the banks and <LOC> Greece </LOC> , <PER> Merkel </PER> said <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> were working on steps to boost economic coordination in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone and said their proposals would necessitate changes to the bloc ¡¯s <LOC> Lisbon </LOC> Treaty . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> made clear , however , that <LOC> Europe </LOC> needed to ¡° take decisions now , ¡± rather than announce long - term plans that would take time to implement . 

Changing the treaty could take several years . 

¡° Comprehensive , sustainable and rapid responses before the end of the month . 

That is the result of this Franco - <MISC> German </MISC> meeting , ¡± he said . 

<MISC> German </MISC> news agency <ORG> DPA </ORG> , citing financial sources , reported on Sunday that <MISC> euro </MISC> zone finance ministers were working on scenarios involving a 60 percent reduction in <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s debt .

The leaders of <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> promised on Sunday to unveil a new comprehensive package for solving the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis by the end of the month , but offered no details and papered over differences on how to shore up <MISC> European </MISC> banks . 

<MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> said after talks in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> their goal was to come up with a sustainable answer for <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s woes , agree how to recapitalise banks and present a plan for accelerating economic coordination in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone by a G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> on Nov. 3 - 4 .

¡° We need to deliver a response that is sustainable and comprehensive . 

We have decided to provide this response by the end of the month because <LOC> Europe </LOC> must solve its problems by the G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> will host the <LOC> Cannes summit </LOC> and is keen to deliver a big success that might bolster his flagging chances of winning re - election in a presidential vote next year . 

But even if the two leaders can agree on a way forward , the experience of the past two years has shown that they could struggle to get the other 15 countries in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone on board in a timely fashion . 

Pressed by reporters , both leaders refused repeatedly to discuss details of their plan . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> said he and <PER> Merkel </PER> were in ¡° total agreement ¡± on the recapitalisation of <MISC> European </MISC> banks , even though officials in <LOC> Paris </LOC> and <LOC> Berlin </LOC> have made clear in recent days that the countries are far apart . 

The two <MISC> euro </MISC> zone heavyweights have come under pressure worldwide to resolve a crisis which is roiling markets . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> President Barack Obama on Thursday urged <LOC> Europe </LOC> to ¡° act fast ¡± , calling the common currency bloc ¡¯s crisis the largest obstacle to a recovery in the <LOC> United States </LOC> . 

World Bank President <PER> Robert Zoellick </PER> told <MISC> German </MISC> magazine <ORG> Wirtschaftswoche </ORG> magazine that there was a ¡° total lack ¡± of vision in <LOC> Europe </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> in particular needed to show more leadership . 

Following the news conference , the leaders of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s two biggest economies were due to hold a working dinner at the Chancellery . 

The implosion of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> lender <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , the first bank to fall victim to the two - year - old <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis , has added a sense of urgency to the talks . 

The prime ministers of <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Belgium </LOC> and the finance minister of <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> agreed a rescue plan for <ORG> Dexia </ORG> on Sunday ahead of the meeting in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> . 

Other <MISC> French </MISC> banks have come under intense pressure because of their exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> and other weak countries on <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s southern periphery . 

<ORG> BNP Paribas </ORG> and <ORG> Societe Generale </ORG> denied a report on Sunday that they could seek to raise a combined 11 billion euros as part of a broader <MISC> European </MISC> recapitalisation plan . 

<LOC> Ireland </LOC> estimated at the weekend that <MISC> European </MISC> banks may need more than 100 billion euros ( $ 135 billion ) to withstand the debt crisis . 

The <ORG> International Monetary Fund </ORG> ( <ORG> IMF </ORG> ) has said they need double that figure . 

<LOC> Paris </LOC> wants to tap the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s 440-billion - <ORG> euro European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> ( <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) to shore up its banks , worried that pouring its own money into them could compromise its coveted triple - A credit rating .

<ORG> European Commission </ORG> head <PER> Jose Manuel Barroso </PER> told <MISC> German </MISC> newspaper <ORG> Bild </ORG> at the weekend that a <MISC> Greek </MISC> default would have unforeseeable consequences and may cause the crisis to spread .

<LOC> JERUSALEM </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> Israeli </MISC> police Sunday said they arrested a second suspect following an arson attack on a mosque blamed on a pro - settler militant group , known by its slogan ¡° price tag . 

<LOC> Israel </LOC> named a special task force to investigate last week ¡¯s blaze in the <MISC> Israeli Arab </MISC> village of <LOC> Tuba </LOC> - <LOC> Zangariya </LOC> , amid fears it may exacerbate tensions with <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> . 

The ¡° Price - Taggers , ¡± also blamed for other assaults on mosques , have said they want to avenge the killing of settlers , and protest against <MISC> Israeli </MISC> efforts to remove unauthorised settlement outposts built on land <MISC> Palestinians </MISC> want for a state . 

The violence has coincided with rising tensions over a <MISC> Palestinian </MISC> application for statehood on <LOC> West Bank land Israel </LOC> captured in a 1967 war , filed at the <ORG> United Nations Security Council </ORG> last month , despite <MISC> Israeli </MISC> and <LOC> U.S. </LOC> objections . 

The suspect , an <MISC> Israeli </MISC> male , would be remanded in a court in the <LOC> Tel Aviv </LOC> area Monday morning , said police spokesman <PER> Micky Rosenfeld </PER> .

A fan who threw a hot dog at <LOC> Tiger Woods </LOC> and missed during Sunday ¡¯s final round of the <MISC> Frys.com Open </MISC> was arrested by local police , officials said . 

As Woods lined up a 19-foot birdie putt at the par - three seventh hole , his 16th of the day , the man ran onto the edge of the green at <LOC> CordeValle Golf </LOC> Club shouting : 

<ORG> ¡° Tiger </ORG> , <ORG> Tiger </ORG> ¡± before hurling the hot dog into the air . 

The man never got closer than 40 feet to Woods , according to <PER> Dan Diggins </PER> , the tournament ¡¯s head of security . 

He immediately fell to the ground and allowed himself to be arrested . 

He was then escorted off the course . 

¡° I turned around and the hot dog was in the air , ¡± <PER> Woods </PER> told reporters after signing off with a three - under - par 68 . 

I guess he wanted to be in the news . 

¡° I was kind of focusing on my putt when he started yelling . 

Looked like he wanted to be arrested really because he laid on the ground , put his hands behind his back and turned his head . ¡± 

<LOC> India </LOC> ¡¯s <PER> Arjun Atwal </PER> , who played with Woods in the final round , described the incident as one of the most bizarre he had seen on a golf course .

<MISC> Canadian </MISC> oil and gas explorer Daylight <ORG> Energy Ltd </ORG> 

<PER> DAY.TO </PER> said on Sunday it has agreed to be acquired by <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp </ORG> for about <MISC> C$ </MISC> 2.2 billion . 

The deal for <LOC> Calgary </LOC> , <LOC> Alberta </LOC> - based Daylight is for <MISC> C$ </MISC> 10.08 per share . 

That is more than double the closing price of Daylight ¡¯s closing price of <MISC> C$ </MISC> 4.59 on Friday , but the company noted it is only a 43.6 percent premium over the 60-day weighted average trading price . 

<ORG> SIPC </ORG> is a subsidiary of <ORG> China Petrochemical Corp </ORG> and undertakes overseas investments and operations in the upstream oil and gas sector , Daylight said in its release announcing the deal . 

The purchase ¡° recognizes the highly attractive asset portfolio and exceptional team that we have assembled at Daylight , ¡± Daylight Chief Executive Officer <PER> Anthony Lambert </PER> said in a statement . 

A combination of falling oil prices and debt levels has hit <MISC> Canadian </MISC> oil and gas shares in recent months as investors fret that growth prospects are shriveling . 

But this deal could be large enough to face review under the Investment <LOC> Canada </LOC> Act , which must determine if foreign purchases of domestic firms are of net benefit to <LOC> Canada </LOC> . 

Still , the energy sector is considered less concentrated than the strategic Potash sector , and previous foreign takeovers of domestic energy firms have gone ahead . 

<ORG> Sinopec </ORG> already owns a stake in the huge <ORG> Syncrude Canada oilsands </ORG> venture . 

Daylight said it expects its deal , which is subject to shareholder approval , to close before the end of the year .

<PER> Warner </PER> is trying to secure a fourth consecutive year of market - share dominance and is currently ahead of No . 2 Paramount by $ 47.7 million . 

But <ORG> Paramount </ORG> has number of notable fourth - quarter releases upcoming , starting next week with its ¡° Footloose ¡± remake , continuing on through part three of its very bankable ¡° Paranormal Activity ¡± franchise , as well as its next <ORG> DreamWorks </ORG> Animation distribution project , ¡° Puss 

<ORG> Paramount </ORG> also has two big family adventure movies coming up with <PER> Martin Scorsese </PER> ¡¯s 

For its part , <PER> Warner </PER> has sequels to ¡° Harold and <PER> Kumar </PER> , ¡± ¡° Happy Feet ¡± and ¡° <PER> Sherlock Holmes </PER> , ¡± but will probably finish second based on remaining volume alone . 

Another interesting race : not to finish last . 

Universal , which has finished in the cellar in domestic revenue among Big 6 studios the last two years , is $ 152.9 million ahead of <PER> Fox </PER> through this weekend . 

Universal ¡¯s upcoming slate includes a prequel to the horror - <MISC> sci classic ¡° </MISC> 

The Thing , ¡± another ¡° <MISC> Johnny English </MISC> ¡± comedy , and the <PER> Brett Ratner </PER> action - <MISC> comedy ¡° Tower Heist </MISC> .

¡± ; another CGI hybrid movie from the very profitable ¡° Alvin and the Chipmunks ¡± well ; and the <PER> Cameron Crowe </PER> dramedy 

The number of financial sectors jobs created in <LOC> London </LOC> dropped 17 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier , while new vacancies fell as much as 6 percent from August to September , two reports showed . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> and <MISC> European </MISC> banks have announced more than 100,000 job cuts so far this year , and there are many more to come , analysts and headhunters reckon . 

Recruitment consultants <PER> Astbury Marsden </PER> said on Monday that 12,750 jobs in <LOC> London </LOC> ¡¯s financial districts were created in the three months to September , or a 17 percent drop on the third quarter of 2010 . 

But they added that the month - on - month decline in new jobs had slowed recently . 

They estimated the number of new vacancies in September was 5 percent lower than in August . 

Rival recruiters <PER> Morgan McKinley </PER> said in a separate report that new job opportunities had fallen by 6 percent in that same period . 

<PER> Morgan McKinley </PER> added that the number of new roles created in September was 19 percent lower than a year ago . 

Demand for regulatory and compliance staff remained robust , however , with a rogue trading scandal at <ORG> UBS </ORG>

* Deal more than double Daylight ¡¯s Friday close 

* 43.6 percent premium based on 60-day average 

Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> Canadian </MISC> oil and gas explorer <ORG> Daylight Energy Ltd </ORG> said on Sunday it has agreed to be acquired by <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp </ORG> for about <MISC> C$ </MISC> 2.2 billion . 

The deal for <LOC> Calgary </LOC> , <LOC> Alberta </LOC> - based Daylight is for <MISC> C$ </MISC> 10.08 per share . 

That is more than double the closing price of Daylight ¡¯s closing price of <MISC> C$ </MISC> 4.59 on Friday , but the company noted it is only a 43.6 percent premium over the 60-day weighted average trading price . 

<ORG> SIPC </ORG> is a subsidiary of <ORG> China Petrochemical Corp </ORG> and undertakes overseas investments and operations in the upstream oil and gas sector , Daylight said in its release announcing the deal . 

The purchase ¡° recognizes the highly attractive asset portfolio and exceptional team that we have assembled at Daylight , ¡± Daylight Chief Executive Officer <PER> Anthony Lambert </PER> said in a statement . 

A combination of falling oil prices and debt levels has hit <MISC> Canadian </MISC> oil and gas shares in recent months as investors fret that growth prospects are shriveling . 

The transaction would mark the latest energy sector deal between <LOC> China </LOC> and <LOC> Canada </LOC> . 

In July , <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s top offshore oil producer , <ORG> CNOOC Ltd </ORG> agreed to buy struggling <ORG> Opti Canada Inc </ORG> for $ 34 million and $ 2 billion in debt . 

But this deal could be large enough to face review under the Investment <LOC> Canada </LOC> Act , which must determine if foreign purchases of domestic firms are of net benefit to <LOC> Canada </LOC> . 

Just under a year ago the government vetoed <ORG> BHP Billiton </ORG> ¡¯s $ 38 billion offer for <LOC> Saskatchewan </LOC> - based <ORG> Potash Corp </ORG> , only the second such veto under the legislation , a move that prompted concern among international investors who worried that <LOC> Canada </LOC> was not <MISC> ¡® open </MISC> for business¡¯ . 

Still , the energy sector is considered less concentrated than the strategic Potash sector , and previous foreign takeovers of domestic energy firms have gone ahead . 

<ORG> Sinopec </ORG> already owns a stake in the huge <ORG> Syncrude Canada oilsands </ORG> venture . 

In April , <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s biggest metals trading firm , <ORG> Minmetals Resources </ORG> , said it had offered <MISC> C$ </MISC> 6.3 billion to buy <LOC> Sydney </LOC> and <LOC> Toronto </LOC> - listed <MISC> African </MISC> copper producer Equinox Minerals . 

However , it dropped its proposal not because of regulatory issues , but because Minmetals¡¯ offer was trumped by a $ 7.7 billion cash bid by <ORG> Barrick Gold Corp </ORG> just weeks later . 

Daylight said it expects its deal , which is subject to shareholder approval , to close before the end of the year .

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Britain </LOC> has relaxed its visa rules to combat an acute shortage of <ORG> actuaries </ORG> triggered by the insurance industry ¡¯s preparations for new <MISC> European </MISC> capital rules , recruitment firm ReThink Recruitment said on Monday . 

The <MISC> British </MISC> government <ORG> ¡¯s Migration Advisory Committee </ORG> last month added <ORG> actuaries </ORG> ¡ª who specialise in assessing risk ¡ª to its list of shortage occupations , making it easier to recruit them from outside the <ORG> European Union </ORG> , Rethink said . 

Insurers have complained that a sharp rise in actuaries¡¯ average pay has inflated the cost of preparing for the <ORG> EU </ORG> ¡¯s so - called Solvency II capital regime , scheduled to come into force in January 2013 . 

According to ReThink , actuaries¡¯ average pay has risen by about a quarter over the past year , with staff at director level earning up to 150,000 pounds ( $ 234,000 ) a year . 

The Association of <MISC> British </MISC> Insurers has put the cost of adapting to Solvency II at 100 million pounds for big multinational companies , while the <ORG> Lloyd ¡¯s of London </ORG> 

insurance market has said it is on course to spend over 250 million pounds . 

Evidence gathered by the Migration Advisory Committee suggests there has been a 30 to 40 percent increase in demand for <ORG> actuaries </ORG> , and newly qualified members of the profession now earn a starting salary of up to 55,000 pounds a year on average . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Rioting in <LOC> England </LOC> over the summer has contributed to an increase in the number of wealthy people considering leaving <LOC> Britain </LOC> , a <ORG> Lloyds TSB </ORG> International Wealth survey said on Monday . 

The survey of 1,057 people said 17 percent of those with more than 250,000 pounds ( $ 390,424 ) of savings and investments wanted to move overseas in the next two years , up from 14 percent six months ago . 

Sixty - one percent of those actively considering an overseas move said crime and antisocial behaviour was the key reason to leave . 

This was up from 43 percent and reflected concerns caused by riots in <LOC> London </LOC> and other major cities in August . 

Sadly it seems August ¡¯s riots , tax increases and a rising cost of living have cast a pall over life in the <LOC> UK </LOC> for some wealthy people , ¡± <PER> Nicholas Boys Smith </PER> , Managing Director of <ORG> Lloyds TSB International Wealth </ORG> , said in a statement . 

¡° It may re - ignite fears of a ¡® wealth drain¡¯ from our economy as rich people seek pastures new , ¡± he added . 

The August riots , which led to several deaths , were sparked after police in <LOC> London </LOC> shot dead a suspected criminal , who was said by his family to have been innocent . 

Violence broke out in several districts of the <MISC> British </MISC> capital and then spread to other cities , with widespread damage as shops were burnt and looted . 

<LOC> ANCHORAGE </LOC> , <LOC> Alaska </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Two of three killer whales that wandered far up an <LOC> Alaska </LOC> river have died , apparently succumbing to stresses associated with being out of their saltwater habitat , federal officials said on Sunday . 

The surviving whale was seen swimming downriver Saturday toward possible safety , officials with the <ORG> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ¡¯s Fisheries Service </ORG> said . 

Biologists were concerned about the three whales because they had spent three weeks in southwest <LOC> Alaska </LOC> ¡¯s salmon - rich <LOC> Nushagak </LOC> River and were lingering as far as 30 miles upstream from where the river flows into the saltwater of <LOC> Bristol Bay </LOC> . 

It was the first time killer whales had been documented lingering far upriver in any area of <LOC> Alaska </LOC> , according to <ORG> NOAA Fisheries </ORG> officials . 

The two whale deaths were confirmed late Saturday by a biologist with the <ORG> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service </ORG> , <ORG> NOAA </ORG> said . 

Federal agencies had been tipped off by a local resident who reported seeing a floating carcass , and the biologist who searched the area by air found both of the dead whales , one floating and one on the riverbank , <ORG> NOAA </ORG> said . 

When last seen swimming in the <LOC> Nushagak River </LOC> , all the whales had a filmy coating on their skin , a sign of stress . 

Fresh water has a different chemical makeup than saltwater and prolonged exposure is dangerous for killer whales , said <PER> Julie Speegle </PER> , a <ORG> NOAA </ORG> spokeswoman in <LOC> Juneau </LOC> , <LOC> Alaska </LOC> . 

¡° Saltwater is their natural habitat , ¡± she said . 

¡° They do often swim into fresh water pursuing prey , but usually they turn around and go back into the saltwater . 

A team of <ORG> NOAA </ORG> - led biologists plan to conduct necropsies on the dead whales on Monday or Tuesday , <PER> Speegle </PER> said . 

Meanwhile , biologists are still surveying the area to try to find the surviving whale and , if necessary , will consider steps to shoo it back into its saltwater habitat , she said . 

The <MISC> National Football League </MISC> ( NFL ) will consider adding a second game in <LOC> London </LOC> to its regular season schedule , commissioner <PER> Roger Goodell </PER> said on Sunday . 

<PER> Goodell </PER> said the tremendous support the NFL has enjoyed in <LOC> London </LOC> has opened the door to bringing a second game to the <MISC> British </MISC> capital next season . 

He made the comments during a wide ranging discussion at a fan forum ahead of the <ORG> Buffalo Bills </ORG> - <ORG> Philadelphia Eagles </ORG> game , 

The NFL played its first regular season games in <LOC> London </LOC> in 2007 . 

This season ¡¯s matchup will feature the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Bears against the <ORG> Tampa Bay Buccaneers </ORG> on October 23 at <LOC> Wembley Stadium </LOC> . 

It ¡¯s been tremendously successful , ¡± <PER> Goodell </PER> said of previous games . 

We have sold that game out in the matter of hours . 

This year , because of the lockout , we did n¡¯t start selling tickets until mid - August so we still have some tickets , but fan reaction has been overwhelmingly positive and we want to build on that . 

We ¡¯re going to talk about it at our league meeting on Tuesday with maybe the potential of expanding it to two games in <LOC> London </LOC> . ¡± 

While <PER> Goodell </PER> expressed his excitement about the success of the <MISC> London games </MISC> , he was not as enthused about the Bills¡¯ contests being played across the <MISC> Canadian </MISC> border in <LOC> Toronto </LOC> , saying the fan experience needed to be improved . 

In an attempt to expand their fan base , the Bills sold five regular season games and three preseason contests between 2008 and 2012 to <LOC> Toronto </LOC> for $ 78 million . 

But ticket sales have often been slow . 

¡° I think we can do it better and so do the Bills and so do the ( <LOC> Toronto </LOC> ) people , ¡± said <PER> Goodell </PER> . 

¡° We want to try and make that better for the fans that go from <LOC> Buffalo </LOC> up to the series , and also for the fans there in <LOC> Toronto </LOC> . ¡±

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s debt crisis is hitting the health of the nation hard , with the number of suicides increasing , more people turning to drugs and prostitution and rapidly rising rates of HIV infections , researchers said on Monday . 

Swingeing budget cuts and growing unemployment are pushing more people into severe depression and drug - dependence , and cutbacks in hospital budgets and healthcare services mean fewer people can see their doctors or access help . 

The picture of health in <LOC> Greece </LOC> is concerning , ¡± said <PER> David Stuckler </PER> , a sociologist at <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> University of Cambridge </ORG> who reported his findings in the <ORG> Lancet medical journal </ORG> . 

¡ª a doubling of suicides , rising homicides , a 50 percent rise in HIV infections and people reporting that their health has got worse 

but they ¡¯re not going to the doctor even though they felt they needed to . 

In the past two years , the <MISC> Greek </MISC> government has imposed harsh austerity measures to deal with a debt mountain as the country plummeted into its deepest recession in 40 years and was forced to accept an <ORG> EU </ORG> - IMF bailout . 

<LOC> Greece </LOC> is expected to run out of cash as soon as mid - November . 

Inspectors from the <ORG> European Union </ORG> , the <ORG> International Monetary Fund </ORG> and the <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> 

¡± ¡ª are currently assessing whether <LOC> Athens </LOC> has fulfilled the criteria for more aid . 

In the meantime , businesses are shutting down , the public sector is shrinking and unemployment is running at more than 16 percent . 

Health budget cuts have also led <LOC> Greece </LOC> to slash the prices it will pay for medicines , triggering supply concerns . 

<PER> Stuckler </PER> ¡¯s team found that suicides rose by 17 percent in 2009 from 2007 and said unofficial data quoted in <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s parliament point to even greater rises , of 25 to 40 percent . 

The data mirror grim local news reports . 

In tales that have shocked Athenians , a former businessman was reported to have jumped to his death leaving a note saying the financial crisis drove him to it , and the owner of a small retail firm was found hanging from rope tied to a bridge . 

His suicide note said simply : ¡° Do n¡¯t look for other reasons . 

The economic crisis led me to this . ¡± 

<PER> Martin McKee </PER> of the <ORG> London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine </ORG> , who worked with Stuckler on the <ORG> Lancet </ORG> paper , said other struggling <ORG> European nations </ORG> should take note . 

The experience of <LOC> Greece </LOC> is a warning of what can happen if there are major cuts to healthcare in the face of a recession , ¡± he said in a telephone interview . 

A previous study by <PER> McKee </PER> , Stuckler and others in July found suicide rates across <LOC> Europe </LOC> rose sharply in the two years to 2009 as the financial crisis drove unemployment up and squeezed incomes . 

In Monday ¡¯s paper , the researchers also found a significant increase in HIV infections in <LOC> Greece </LOC> in late 2010 and said data suggest that new infections with the virus that causes AIDS will rise by 52 percent this year compared to last . 

Rates of heroin use rose by 20 percent in 2009 , and at the same time , budget cuts in 2009 and 2010 meant a loss of a third of the country ¡¯s street - work programs designed to help drug addicts and provide them with HIV prevention services . 

<PER> Stuckler </PER> said there were reports of some drug users deliberately infecting themselves with HIV , or human immunodeficiency virus , to get access to welfare benefits of 700 euros ( $ 940 ) a month and faster admission into drug substitution programs . 

<LOC> Greece </LOC> has had a rocky relationship with pharmaceutical companies as a result of the crisis , imposing some of the most draconian price cuts for medicines of any <MISC> European </MISC> country , with unpaid bills a further burden for pharmaceutical companies . 

<MISC> Swiss </MISC> group <PER> Roche </PER> has stopped delivering cancer drugs to some state - funded <MISC> Greek </MISC> hospitals that have not paid their bills , with patients being told to collect medicines from privately run pharmacies as they are more reliable payers . 

<PER> Roche </PER> and other drugmakers have also been forced to accept <MISC> Greek </MISC> government bonds instead of cash for some outstanding debts ¡ª a move that is expected to increase bad debt provisions , although <LOC> Greece </LOC> accounts for only around 1 percent of the global pharmaceuticals market .

* <PER> Merkel </PER> , <PER> Sarkozy </PER> vow crisis package by end - Oct , give no details 

* Package to include plan for <LOC> Greece </LOC> , banks , economic coordination 

* <LOC> UK </LOC> ¡¯s <PER> Cameron </PER> urges ¡° big bazooka ¡± approach 

The leaders of <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> have promised to unveil new measures to solve the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis by the end of the month , as international pressure builds for bold steps from <LOC> Europe </LOC> to avert an economic backlash of global proportions . 

<MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> said after talks in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> on Sunday evening that their goal was to come up with a sustainable answer for <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s woes , agree how to recapitalise <MISC> European </MISC> banks and present a plan for accelerating economic coordination in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone by a G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> on Nov. 3 - 4 . 

But they declined to reveal any details of their plan . 

As they met , <MISC> British </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> David Cameron </PER> urged them to take a ¡° big bazooka ¡± approach to the crisis , telling the Financial Times that <MISC> euro </MISC> zone leaders had to break their cycle of doing ¡° a bit too little , a bit too late ¡± . 

<PER> Merkel </PER> and <PER> Sarkozy </PER> were due to hold a working dinner after their news conference . 

¡° We are very conscious that <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> have a particular responsibility for stabilising the <MISC> euro </MISC> , ¡± <PER> Sarkozy </PER> said , standing next to <PER> Merkel </PER> . 

¡° We need to deliver a response that is sustainable and comprehensive . 

We have decided to provide this response by the end of the month because <LOC> Europe </LOC> must solve its problems by the G20 summit in <LOC> Cannes </LOC> . 

Financial markets were hoping the meeting of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s top two leaders would produce a breakthrough , and the lack of concrete steps could hurt sentiment on Monday . 

It ¡¯s great to see <PER> Sarkozy </PER> and <PER> Merkel </PER> talking , but they have to come up with some firm conclusions on what needs to be done , ¡± said <PER> Chris Wheeler </PER> , an analyst at <ORG> Mediobanca </ORG> in <LOC> London </LOC> . 

¡° The end of the month is a long way away . 

There has to be some clarity on what we need and it ¡¯s not coming through . ¡± 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> will host the <LOC> Cannes summit </LOC> and is keen to deliver a big success that might bolster his chances of winning re - election in a presidential vote next year . 

The <MISC> French </MISC> leader said he and <PER> Merkel </PER> were in ¡° total agreement ¡± on the recapitalisation of <MISC> European </MISC> banks , even though officials in <LOC> Paris </LOC> and <LOC> Berlin </LOC> have made clear in recent days that the countries are far apart . 

Foreign leaders are looking on in horror at the squabbling , fearful the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone crisis could plunge their own economies back into recession . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> President Barack Obama on Thursday urged <LOC> Europe </LOC> to ¡° act fast ¡± , calling the crisis the largest obstacle to a recovery in the <LOC> United States </LOC> . 

<PER> Cameron </PER> , in an interview with the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> , pressed <MISC> euro </MISC> zone leaders to increase the firepower of their 440 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> rescue fund ¡ª 

the <ORG> European Financial Stability Facility </ORG> ( <ORG> EFSF </ORG> ) 

¡ª and to remove all uncertainty about <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s economic future . 

The <MISC> British </MISC> leader said he had conveyed his concerns that the currency bloc was acting too cautiously to <PER> Merkel </PER> personally over the weekend . 

The implosion of <MISC> Belgian </MISC> lender <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , the first bank to fall victim to the two - year - old <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis , has added a sense of urgency to the talks . 

The prime ministers of <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Belgium </LOC> and the finance minister of <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> agreed a rescue plan for <ORG> Dexia </ORG> on Sunday . 

Other <MISC> French </MISC> banks have also come under intense pressure because of their exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> . 

A senior banker told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> in <LOC> Paris </LOC> that <MISC> French </MISC> politicians were worried that even an orderly <MISC> Greek </MISC> debt default could floor <MISC> French </MISC> banks and were pushing for action to bolster capital levels . 

<LOC> Paris </LOC> wants to tap the EFSF to shore up its banks , worried that pouring its own money into them could compromise its coveted triple - A credit rating . 

Officials in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> have made clear that they believe the fund should be used only as a last resort , when <MISC> euro </MISC> zone member states do n¡¯t have the means to support their banks on their own . 

Another area of contention is how to use a new , enhanced EFSF to buy sovereign debt ¡ª an issue that would become particularly crucial if <LOC> Greece </LOC> failed to secure a new aid tranche . 

<LOC> Athens </LOC> is expected to run out of cash as soon as mid - November . 

Inspectors from the <ORG> European Commission </ORG> , the IMF and the <ORG> European Central Bank </ORG> ¡ª the so - called <ORG> ¡° troika </ORG> 

¡± ¡ª are currently assessing whether the country has fulfilled the criteria for more aid . 

<LOC> Greece </LOC> has repeatedly failed to meet fiscal targets set out for it by the troika and its economy has performed far worse than predicted . 

In addition to addressing the banks and <LOC> Greece </LOC> , <PER> Merkel </PER> said <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> were working on steps to boost economic coordination in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone and said their proposals would necessitate changes to the bloc ¡¯s <LOC> Lisbon </LOC> Treaty . 

<PER> Sarkozy </PER> made clear , however , that <LOC> Europe </LOC> needed to ¡° take decisions now ¡± , rather than announce long - term plans that would take time to implement . 

Changing the treaty could take several years . 

¡° Comprehensive , sustainable and rapid responses before the end of the month . 

That is the result of this Franco - <MISC> German </MISC> meeting , ¡± he said . 

<MISC> German </MISC> news agency <ORG> DPA </ORG> , citing financial sources , reported on Sunday that <MISC> euro </MISC> zone finance ministers were working on scenarios involving a 60 percent reduction in <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s debt . 

<LOC> South Korea </LOC> raised domestic gas rates by 5.3 percent on average on Monday in a move to reflect higher import costs of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) and help cut losses in state - <ORG> run Korea Gas Corp </ORG> ( <ORG> KOGAS </ORG> ) , the <ORG> economy ministry </ORG> said . 

<LOC> Asia </LOC> ¡¯s fourth - largest economy , like other regional peers , has been fighting to tame inflation led by costlier energy and commodities , and had refrained from increasing utilities charges . 

The decision has been made to reflect recent higher import costs of LNG and to recoup accumulated account receivable of <ORG> Korea Gas Corp </ORG> as soon as possible , ¡± the ministry said in a statement . 

<LOC> South Korea </LOC> is the world ¡¯s second largest LNG importer after <LOC> Japan </LOC> , and the world ¡¯s fifth - largest crude oil importer . 

<ORG> KOGAS </ORG> , the world ¡¯s largest corporate buyer of LNG , says its losses resulted from gas import costs that are higher than its domestic charges . 

As of August this year , the loss had mounted to 4.1 trillion won ( $ 3.48 billion ) , according to the ministry statement . 

¡° Considering the losses to recoup , we found the hike should be made by at least 7.9 percent but decided to modify the hike to 5.3 percent to help reduce burdens on common citizens , ¡± it said . 

The increases in tariffs apply to domestic gas rates in residential , commercial and industrial consumption , it added . 

<MISC> South Korean </MISC> consumer inflation in September eased to 4.3 percent from a year earlier , coming off a three - year high of 5.3 percent set in August .

<LOC> New Zealand </LOC> financial company <ORG> Pyne Gould Corp Ltd </ORG> is the subject of a $ 55 million takeover offer , the company said on Monday . 

The company , which has sold assets into a new banking company called Heartland , said a company associated with one of its major shareholders , <PER> George Kerr </PER> , has offered 33 <LOC> NZ </LOC> cents a share for all the company ¡¯s stock , valuing it at NZ$71.5 million . 

<ORG> PGC </ORG> shares last traded steady at NZ$0.27 . 

<LOC> CAIRO </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> Christians </MISC> clashed with military police , leaving at least 24 people dead in <LOC> Cairo </LOC> , and the cabinet called an emergency meeting for Monday , vowing the violence would not derail <LOC> Egypt </LOC> ¡¯s first election since <PER> Hosni Mubarak </PER> was toppled . 

<MISC> Christians </MISC> protesting about an attack on a church set cars on fire , burned army vehicles and hurled rocks at military police who they said used heavy - handed tactics against them . 

It was some of the worst violence since the February uprising . 

The violence casts a shadow over the imminent parliamentary election . 

Voting starts on 

November 28 with candidates due to begin registering during the week starting Wednesday . 

The clashes also added to growing frustration among activists with the army who many <MISC> Egyptians </MISC> suspect wants to keep hold of the reins of power from behind the scenes even as it hands over day - to - day government . 

This is a dark day in the military ¡¯s history . 

This is betrayal , a conspiracy , murder , ¡± <PER> Magdy el </PER> - <PER> Serafy </PER> wrote on Twitter where he and other <MISC> Egyptians </MISC> voiced frustration at the army ¡¯s handling of the protest . 

The <ORG> Health Ministry </ORG> said the death toll had reached 24 with 213 injured , the official <ORG> MENA </ORG> news agency reported . 

It did not identify the dead but state television had earlier reported three soldiers were killed . 

Prime Minister <PER> Essam Sharaf </PER> toured the area near the state television building where clashes erupted , <PER> MENA </PER> said , adding he spoke to those in the area to hear their accounts of events . 

¡° What happened in front of the state TV building is exactly what happened on January 25 , ¡± wrote <MISC> Muslim </MISC> activist <PER> Asmaa Mahfouz </PER> , referring to the start of the anti - <PER> Mubarak </PER> uprising . 

<MISC> Christians </MISC> , who make up 10 percent of <LOC> Egypt </LOC> ¡¯s roughly 80 million people , took to the streets after blaming <MISC> Muslim </MISC> radicals for partially demolishing a church in <LOC> Aswan </LOC> province last week . 

They also demanded the sacking of the province ¡¯s governor for failing to protect the building . 

Tensions between <MISC> Christians </MISC> and <MISC> Muslims </MISC> have increased since the uprising . 

But <MISC> Muslim </MISC> and <MISC> Christian </MISC> activists said the violence Sunday was not due to sectarian differences but was directed at the army ¡¯s handling of the protest . 

Instead of advancing to build a modern state of <MISC> democratic </MISC> principles , we are back searching for security and stability , worrying that there are hidden hands , both domestic and foreign , seeking to obstruct the will of <MISC> Egyptians </MISC> in establishing a democracy , ¡± <PER> Sharaf </PER> said on state television . 

¡° We will not surrender to these malicious conspiracies and we will not accept reverting back , ¡± he said in his address . 

The cabinet said in a statement that it would ¡° not let any group manipulate the issue of <ORG> national unity </ORG> in <LOC> Egypt </LOC> or delay the process of <MISC> democratic </MISC> transformation 

¡± which it said would begin with opening the doors to candidate nominations . 

Cabinet spokesman <PER> Mohamed Hegazy </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> the cabinet would hold a special session Monday to discuss the events . 

The most important thing is to contain the situation , see the way forward and the necessary measures to avoid any ramifications , ¡± <PER> Hegazy </PER> said , adding a committee of prominent figures from the church and <LOC> Al </LOC> - <LOC> Azhar </LOC> mosque would also meet . 

Presidential candidate <PER> Amr Moussa </PER> and political groups said they would hold an emergency meeting Monday about the violence . 

The army imposed a curfew on <LOC> Cairo </LOC> ¡¯s <LOC> Tahrir </LOC> Square , the focus for protests that brought down <PER> Mubarak </PER> , and the downtown area . 

It was set from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. , ( 0000 - 0500 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) . 

Pictures of smashed faces and dead bodies of what activists said were bodies run over by military vehicles circulated online , with angry comments comparing the violence used by the military to that of <PER> Mubarak </PER> ¡¯s hated police in the uprising . 

¡° What happened today is unprecedented in <LOC> Egypt </LOC> . 

17 corpses crushed by military tanks , ¡± <PER> Hossam Bahgat </PER> , human rights activist tweeted from hospital . 

I saw bodies missing hands and legs , heads twisted away or plastered to the ground . 

Protesters also took to the streets in <LOC> Alexandria </LOC> , <LOC> Egypt </LOC> ¡¯s second city . 

In comments published on his Facebook page , <PER> Sharaf </PER> said he had contacted security and church authorities about the situation , saying the one ones to benefit were the ¡° enemies of the January revolution . ¡±

<ORG> TUNIS </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Police in <LOC> Tunis </LOC> used teargas on Sunday to disperse hundreds of <MISC> Islamists </MISC> attacking them with stones , knives and batons , the biggest clashes over religion in the <MISC> Tunisian </MISC> capital for several years . 

Tension is mounting before an election later this month , the first since a revolution toppled <LOC> Tunisia </LOC> ¡¯s autocratic leader , that will pit <MISC> Islamists </MISC> free to express their beliefs for the first time against <MISC> secularists </MISC> who say their liberal values are under threat . 

The <MISC> Islamists </MISC> were protesting against a ban on women who wear the niqab , or full - face veil , enrolling in university , and the decision by a <MISC> Tunisian </MISC> television station to broadcast animated film ¡° Persepolis ¡± which they said denigrated <PER> Islam </PER> . 

Several hundred protesters gathered outside the main university campus in <LOC> Tunis </LOC> , and from there went to the working - class neighbourhood of <LOC> Jebel El </LOC> - <LOC> Ahmar </LOC> , <LOC> north of the city center </LOC> , where the clashes with police broke out . 

About 100 police vehicles , and several hundred police officers wearing anti - riot gear were deployed . 

A <ORG> Reuters </ORG> reporter said he saw officers running to escape the protesters . 

The mainly young protesters blocked a main road and threw stones at vehicles trying to get through . 

( <PER> God </PER> is greatest ) and ¡° We will die for <MISC> Allah ! ¡± </MISC> 

<MISC> Tunisians </MISC> will vote in an October 23 election for an assembly to draft a new constitution . 

The <MISC> Islamist </MISC> <ORG> Ennahda party </ORG> is expected to win the biggest share of the vote , alarming <MISC> secularists </MISC> who have traditionally dominated the ruling elite . 

The clashes on Sunday are ¡° a very bad sign for the holding of <MISC> democratic </MISC> elections , ¡± analyst <PER> Salah Attya </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

There are certain sides or parties which are pushing for an explosion of the situation before the election , ¡± he said . 

A spokesman for the <ORG> Interior Ministry </ORG> , <PER> Hichem Meddeb </PER> , said the religious sensitivities of pious <MISC> Muslims </MISC> should be respected but added : ¡° People who are opposed should react in a peaceful way . 

We are committed to defending all the institutions and individuals in this country . ¡± 

<LOC> Tunisia </LOC> is the birthplace of the ¡° <MISC> Arab </MISC> Spring ¡± uprisings . 

Mass protests in January ousted president <PER> Zine al </PER> - <PER> Abidine Ben Ali </PER> , electrifying the <MISC> Arab </MISC> world and helping inspire revolts in <LOC> Egypt </LOC> , <LOC> Libya </LOC> , <LOC> Yemen </LOC> , <LOC> Bahrain </LOC> and <LOC> Syria </LOC> . 

The new caretaker government scheduled <MISC> democratic </MISC> elections and allowed <MISC> Islamists </MISC> to run for the first time , unleashing a tense debate about the role of religion in society . 

The latest round of unrest broke out on Saturday when <MISC> Islamists </MISC> tried to storm a university in <LOC> Sousse </LOC> , about 150 km ( 93 miles ) south of <LOC> Tunis </LOC> . 

Administrators , enforcing a government ruling , had refused to enrol a woman wearing the niqab . 

Earlier on Sunday , <MISC> Islamists </MISC> protested outside the offices of the private <ORG> Nessma </ORG> television station in the center of <LOC> Tunis </LOC> . 

The station angered some conservative <MISC> Muslims </MISC> by broadcasting ¡° <ORG> Persepolis </ORG> , ¡± an award - winning film based on an account of a woman growing up in <LOC> Iran </LOC> under strict religious rule following the 1979 <MISC> Islamic </MISC> revolution . 

Witnesses told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> about 300 protesters , some with sticks and knives , tried to set fire to the television station but were prevented from doing so by a large number of police . 

At least 40 people were arrested , the witnesses said . 

<PER> Ennahda </PER> , a moderate group which says it respects women ¡¯s rights and does not want to impose its religious values on <MISC> Tunisian </MISC> society , condemned Sunday ¡¯s violence . 

¡° I am against infringing on the sentiments of people and their religion , but that does not stop us being completely against violence , whatever form it is in , 

¡± said an <ORG> Ennahda </ORG> official , <PER> Ali Larayad </PER> . 

We are in favor of peaceful protests to demand rights and on principle we condemn violence . ¡± 

<LOC> Seoul </LOC> shares are expected to open higher on Monday after encouraging <LOC> U.S. </LOC> job data and amid hopes that <LOC> Europe </LOC> is dealing with deal crisis , analysts said . 

¡° Market will probably start off in positive territory . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> job data came out stronger than expected , and this helps ease <LOC> U.S. </LOC> recession concerns , ¡± said <PER> Kim Seung </PER> - <PER> han </PER> , a market analyst at <ORG> HI Investment & Securities </ORG> . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> employers hired more workers than expected in September and job gains for the prior two months were revised higher , data showed on Friday .

<LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s new government led by the center - right Civic Platform will continue to push through gradual economic reforms with its previous coalition partner , the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> , a top aide to Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> on Sunday . 

At the time of a global crisis , such turmoil on the global markets , even gradual reforms will require brave decisions and our coalition will continue to do them effectively , ¡± <PER> Michal Boni </PER> said . 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s Civic Platform wins new four - year term 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> to seek new coalition with <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> 

* Analysts welcome outcome as sign of stability 

<PER> Donald Tusk </PER> will be the first <MISC> Polish </MISC> prime minister since the fall of communism in 1989 to rule for two successive terms after his centre - right Civic Platform trounced its rivals in a parliamentary election . 

An exit poll showed <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s pro - business party had won nearly 40 percent of votes in Sunday ¡¯s election , short of an absolute majority but far ahead of <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s nationalist - conservative <ORG> Law and Justice party </ORG> on just over 30 percent . 

Financial markets will welcome <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s victory , which points to four more years of relative political and economic stability in the <ORG> European Union </ORG> ¡¯s largest eastern member state at a time of deepening crisis in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone . 

Final official results are not expected until Tuesday evening , but a jubilant <PER> Tusk </PER> swiftly claimed victory and <PER> Kaczynski </PER> conceded defeat . 

Projections based on the exit poll , conducted by <ORG> TNS OBOP </ORG> for national television , showed that <ORG> PO </ORG> and its preferred coalition partner , the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> ( <ORG> PSL </ORG> ) , would together have enough seats to win a majority in the Sejm lower house . 

The leader of the rural - based <ORG> PSL </ORG> , <PER> Waldemar Pawlak </PER> , signalled he was ready to forge a new coalition with <PER> Tusk </PER> . 

¡° The ruling party and coalition for the first time in <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s post - communist history has been re - elected and that shows the consolidation of democracy in <LOC> Poland </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Jacek Raciborski </PER> , a political scientist at <LOC> Warsaw </LOC> University . 

¡° Only the low turnout is worrying , ¡± he added . 

About one in two eligible voters took part in the election , in which a return to power by <PER> Kaczynski </PER> which would have threatened relations with <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> Russia </LOC> and worried investors . 

The <ORG> PAP </ORG> state news agency quoted a senior <ORG> PO </ORG> politician as saying <PER> Tusk </PER> and <PER> Pawlak </PER> might yet fall short of a majority and that Civic Platform might also try to lure members of the <ORG> Democratic Left Alliance </ORG> ( <ORG> SLD </ORG> ) into a new coalition . 

The <ORG> SLD </ORG> , heir to the once - <ORG> mighty Communist Party </ORG> , won a surprisingly poor 7.7 percent , according to the exit poll , while <PER> Pawlak </PER> ¡¯s PSL secured 8.2 percent . 

The outgoing coalition has presided over four years of strong economic growth , steering <LOC> Poland </LOC> smoothly through the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis without dipping into recession . 

Its victory ends a string of defeats for ruling parties in elections in <ORG> EU </ORG> member states this year , including in <LOC> Portugal </LOC> , <LOC> Latvia </LOC> , <LOC> Denmark </LOC> and <LOC> Ireland </LOC> . 

<PER> PO </PER> has pledged more cautious reforms aimed at reining in the public debt and budget deficit , expected to reach 53.8 percent and 5.6 percent respectively this year . 

It also wants to continue a privatisation programme set to net 15 billion zlotys ( $ 4 billion ) for state coffers in 2011 and to pursue closer ties with <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> EU </ORG> partners . 

<MISC> Polish </MISC> President <PER> Bronislaw Komorowski </PER> , a former Civic Platform lawmaker , is now expected to ask <PER> Tusk </PER> to form a government 

but he said he must first wait for the official election results , expected on Tuesday evening . 

I hope that it will be possible to reduce the time necessary for creating the government ... to a minimum , ¡± <PER> Komorowski </PER> said on Sunday evening . 

The result is a personal triumph for <PER> Tusk </PER> , 54 , a pragmatic liberal conservative from near <LOC> Gdansk </LOC> on <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s 

<MISC> Baltic </MISC> coast who was involved in the Solidarity movement that helped end decades of communist rule . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> , whose country holds the <ORG> EU </ORG> presidency until the end of this year , favours closer integration with the rest of the bloc and says joining the <MISC> euro </MISC> remains a strategic goal for <LOC> Poland </LOC> despite the debt crisis in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> has good personal ties with <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and has maintained a cautious rapprochement with <LOC> Russia </LOC> , despite strains over a plane crash there last year that killed then - President <PER> Lech Kaczynski </PER> , <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s twin . 

A government led by <PER> Kaczynski </PER> , 62 , would have been likely to strain <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s relations with its two large neighbours , <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> , as happened when Law and Justice was last in power from 

2005 to 2007 . 

<PER> Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s calls for a halt to privatisation , for higher taxes on the wealthy and for a more combative stance in dealings with the <ORG> EU </ORG> had also unsettled investors . 

The main surprise of this election was the rise of a new liberal grouping , <PER> Palikot </PER> ¡¯s Movement , which the exit poll showed winning 10.1 percent , much of it at the expense of the former communists . 

<PER> Janusz Palikot </PER> , its founder , is a wealthy businessman and former <ORG> PO </ORG> lawmaker whose attacks on the powerful <MISC> Roman Catholic </MISC> Church and championing of causes such as gay rights and legalisation of soft drugs struck a chord among young voters . 

<MISC> Polish </MISC> Finance Minister <PER> Jacek Rostowski </PER> said on Sunday he was ready to remain in his post after his ruling center - right Civic Platform won a parliamentary election , adding that the decision would be for Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> to make . 

<PER> Rostowski </PER> also told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> he stuck with his ambition to reduce <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s budget deficit to below 3 percent of gross domestic product next year , in line with promises to the <ORG> European Union </ORG> . 

Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> claimed victory in Sunday ¡¯s election after exit polls showed his ruling center - right <ORG> Civic Platform party </ORG> comfortably ahead of its rivals . 

I wanted to thank all of those who voted for us and those who did n¡¯t because we will be together bearing responsibility for <LOC> Poland </LOC> for four more years , ¡± <PER> Tusk </PER> said in a televised speech to supporters . 

Reporting by <PER> Gabriela Baczynska </PER> , writing by <PER> Gareth Jones </PER> 

The leader of <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s small <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> said it was ready to join a new coalition government headed by Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> ¡¯s center - right Civic Platform after Sunday ¡¯s parliamentary election . 

A coalition with Civic Platform is possible but we have to give it careful thought , ¡± <PER> Waldemar Pawlak </PER> said on television after an exit poll showed <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s party far ahead of rivals with nearly 40 percent of the vote and the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> with 8.2 percent . 

The two parties have been in a coalition government since 2007 , steering <LOC> Poland </LOC> smoothly through a global financial crisis without going into recession . 

<MISC> Polish </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> claimed victory in a parliamentary election on Sunday and is expected to form a new coalition with his Peasants¡¯ Party allies to press on with gradual economic reforms . 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> , 54 , is rated the most popular of <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s political party leaders in opinion polls , thanks mainly to his success in steering the country relatively safely through the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis . 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> was the only country in the <ORG> 27-member European Union </ORG> to avoid recession during the crisis . 

* A mild - mannered pragmatist with the common touch , he has eschewed radical economic reforms and has tried not to scare Poles with talk of austerity even as his government struggles to rein in a large budget deficit . 

He said before the election it would be his last term as prime minister if he won . 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s <ORG> PO </ORG> won the 2007 parliamentary election on promises to pursue liberal market reforms and improve relations with <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s big neighbors , <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> , and with the <ORG> European Union </ORG> after ties with the bloc became strained under his predecessor , the more nationalist - minded <PER> Kaczynski </PER> . 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> has disappointed financial markets as well as many younger , more liberal voters by not delivering on market reform . 

His government also proved more conservative than promised on social issues such as ¡® in vitro¡¯ fertilization ( IVF ) , abortion and same - sex couples . 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> unexpectedly lost the 2005 presidential election to <PER> Lech Kaczynski </PER> , <PER> Jaroslaw </PER> ¡¯s identical twin brother who was killed in a plane crash in <LOC> Russia </LOC> last year . 

The 2005 defeat was a lesson in humility for <PER> Tusk </PER> who learned to become more cautious about his prospects in subsequent elections . 

* <PER> Tusk </PER> , a historian by education , has a tight grip on his party and so far none of its rival factions has been able to contest his position . 

He is also adept at reacting to the popular mood in <LOC> Poland </LOC> . 

He turns up in areas that have been struck by natural disasters , does not avoid meetings with angry voters and has spoken out against a range of groups including lobbyists , pedophiles , gamblers and soccer hooligans . 

<MISC> Baltic </MISC> coast , <PER> Tusk </PER> was involved in the pro - <ORG> democracy Solidarity movement </ORG> that first emerged in the port city and helped end the collapse of communist rule in 1989 .

<ORG> YAOUNDE </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Opposition leaders and voters in <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> have complained of delays at polling booths and other organizational shortfalls at a presidential election expected to seal a new term for incumbent <PER> Paul Biya </PER> . 

Accounts that some voters cast two ballots while others did not vote at all risk undermining the credibility of the poll in the <MISC> central African </MISC> oil - producer , weeks after a poll in <LOC> Zambia </LOC> showed change through the ballot box is possible in <LOC> Africa </LOC> . 

Sunday ¡¯s polling ended peacefully but power supply problems meant the count in some districts was conducted by candelight , the flashlights of mobile phones or , as at one district in the capital <LOC> Yaounde </LOC> , the headlights of a motorbike . 

Results could take as long as two weeks to emerge . 

Some polling stations opened late , some appeared unclear on the rules about how votes are cast , ¡± <ORG> Commonwealth </ORG> observer mission leader <PER> Frederick Mitchell </PER> said by telephone . 

State media reported that two gendarmes were killed and two others kidnapped by gunmen in the <LOC> Bakassi peninsula </LOC> by the <MISC> Nigerian </MISC> border , the latest in a spate of incidents in a region with separatist tendencies . 

However there was no evidence of a wider political motive . 

<PER> Biya </PER> ¡¯s main rival <PER> John Fru Ndi </PER> of the <ORG> Social Democratic Front </ORG> ( <ORG> SDF </ORG> ) said a surplus of voting slips meant some had voted twice in certain parts of the country and warned election body Elecam would be blamed for the ¡° disorder and confusion . 

Casting his vote , <PER> Biya </PER> asked for patience . 

¡° It ( Elecam ) is a young organization ... 

I ¡¯m just asking that there should be indulgence in any eventual imperfection . 

There was no intention to fraud , ¡± he said . 

That did not satisfy <LOC> Yaounde </LOC> resident <PER> Samuel Enyegueone </PER> of a number of voters interviewed by <ORG> Reuters </ORG> who said he had been unable to cast his vote . 

This is pure rubbish , ¡± said <PER> Enyegue </PER> outside a polling station in the Biyem - <PER> Assi </PER> district . 

I can not understand why I registered but my name is not on the ( voters¡¯ ) list . ¡± 

After voting ended , a <ORG> Reuters </ORG> reporter in <LOC> Yaounde </LOC> saw 19 polling stations where ballots were being counted without the required presence of <ORG> candidates¡¯ representatives </ORG> . 

State media hailed a mass turnout but there was little evidence of queues despite the fact that many polling stations failed to open at 8.00 am local ( 0700 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) as scheduled . 

It is a disgrace that many Cameroonians did not register and even the few who did would not come out to vote , ¡± 53-year - old secondary schoolteacher 

¡° When we do n¡¯t vote how do we ever expect things to change ? 

Aside from its oil , <LOC> Cameroon </LOC> is the region ¡¯s main maritime entry point and breadbasket , supplying <LOC> Chad </LOC> , <LOC> Central African Republic </LOC> , <LOC> Congo Republic </LOC> and <LOC> Gabon </LOC> . 

Yet its economic growth is below average for <LOC> Africa </LOC> and critics cite <MISC> democratic </MISC> failings . 

<PER> Biya </PER> faces 22 candidates including <ORG> Fru Ndi </ORG> , and <PER> Adamou Ndam Njoya </PER> of the <ORG> Cameroon Democratic Union </ORG> ( <ORG> UDC </ORG> ) . 

In the last election in 2004 , <PER> Biya </PER> scored just over 70 percent , while his closest rival , <PER> Fru Ndi </PER> , took 17 percent . 

In 2008 a move by <PER> Biya </PER> to scrap term limits , and anger over food prices , led to street protests in which more than 100 people died , but for most of the past three decades it has seen relative stability in a turbulent region . 

However , one issue which has not gone away is a separatist movement in the south and last week security forces detained more than 200 people after they held a banned rally calling for the right to secede .

<LOC> WARSAW </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Victory for <MISC> Polish </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Donald Tusk </PER> ¡¯s ruling center - right <ORG> Civic Platform </ORG> ( <ORG> PO </ORG> ) in Sunday ¡¯s election brings relief to jittery financial markets but they will soon demand action on cutting the budget deficit and debt . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s PO won nearly 40 percent of the vote , exit polls showed , many more than its nearest rival , <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s nationalist - conservative <ORG> Law and Justice party </ORG> , and is expected to renew its coalition with the small <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> swiftly claimed victory and <PER> Kaczynski </PER> conceded defeat , though final results are not expected until Tuesday evening . 

¡° The markets will treat this result as another feather in <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s cap , ¡± said <PER> Nicholas Spiro </PER> , head of the <LOC> London </LOC> - based consultancy Spiro Sovereign Strategy . 

This is a vote for stability more than anything else . 

It is a vote for gradual and uninspiring reforms . 

From a market standpoint , one of the key anchors of <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s creditworthiness has remained in place . ¡± 

¡° Whether this results in the kind of fiscal and structural reforms <LOC> Poland </LOC> needs is debatable given PO ¡¯s preference for caution , ¡± he added . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s government steered <LOC> Poland </LOC> smoothly through the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis without dipping into recession , though his failure to press more radical market reforms disappointed more liberal supporters . 

Judging by the initial comments of the <PER> Tusk </PER> camp Sunday evening , caution is likely to remain the hallmark of the new government . 

At a time of global crisis , such turmoil on the global markets , even gradual reforms will require brave decisions and our coalition will continue to do them effectively , ¡± <PER> Michal Boni </PER> , an aide to the prime minister , told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> . 

Rating agencies have warned of possible downgrades for <LOC> Poland </LOC> if the new government fails swiftly to rein in public debt and the budget deficit , though Finance Minister <PER> Jacek Rostowski </PER> has ruled out any radical economic changes in the event of a PO election victory . 

<PER> Rostowski </PER> ¡ª who is expected to keep his job in the new government 

¡ª reiterated to <ORG> Reuters </ORG> his plan to bring the deficit to below the <ORG> EU </ORG> ¡¯s 3 percent of gross domestic product next year from an expected 5.6 percent in 2011 . 

Many economist are sceptical that this can be done , especially in view of slowing economic growth . 

<LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s economy is expected to expand by 4 percent this year but the IMF and many banks have now trimmed back their forecasts for 2012 . 

But for now , markets are likely to applaud the election result , especially at a time of crisis in other <MISC> European </MISC> member states as they tackle the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis . 

Investors had feared a messier outcome that could have led to prolonged political horse - trading and a weak three- or even four - party coalition . 

They had also fretted over a possible win for <PER> Kaczynski </PER> , who favours more state involvement in the economy , higher taxes on the rich and an end to large - scale privatisations . 

From the point of view of the markets , this is very good news . 

Investors ( were ) worried that we could see a coalition made up of three parties ... 

I expect a positive opening , stronger zloty and a rise in bond prices , ¡± <PER> Ernest Pytlarczyk </PER> , chief economist at <ORG> BRE Bank </ORG> said Sunday . 

The zloty has lost more than 10 percent against the <MISC> euro </MISC> in the past three months as investors flee riskier emerging markets amid fears over the global economy and the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone crisis . 

Now everybody will keep a close eye on the new government and its main target is fiscal consolidation and defending the debt - to - GDP ratio below 55 percent , ¡± said Pytlarczyk . 

The new government will want to prevent debt from exceeding the 55 percent level because under <MISC> Polish </MISC> law this would automatically trigger deep spending cuts that could further hinder economic growth .

A prominent and influential <MISC> Libyan Islamist </MISC> cleric , returning to 

his native land after the overthrow of <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> , has demanded a role for ¡° moderate ¡± <MISC> Islam </MISC> in politics . 

We call for a moderate <MISC> Islam </MISC> , ¡± <PER> Ali Al </PER> - <PER> Sallabi </PER> said at a meeting late on Sunday that included supporters and opponents . 

But you all have to understand that <MISC> Islam </MISC> is not just about punishment , cutting hands and beheading with swords . 

Though he has no formal political role , Al - <PER> Sallabi </PER> has become a hugely significant voice in <MISC> Libyan </MISC> affairs because he is close to the government of <LOC> Qatar </LOC> , an influential backer of interim rulers the <ORG> National Transitional Council(NTC </ORG> ) . 

He also is a close associate of <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> ¡¯s military commander <PER> Abdel Hakim Belhadj </PER> , a rising ¡ª and increasingly divisive ¡ª 

<MISC> Islamist </MISC> figure in post - Gaddafi <LOC> Libya </LOC> . 

Some <MISC> Libyans </MISC> , including several at the meeting , suspect that Al - <PER> Sallabi </PER> favours introducing a strict form of <MISC> Islamic </MISC> law , or sharia , in a country that has long disavowed militant <MISC> Islam </MISC> . 

<LOC> Qatar </LOC> is a super - rich nation with a tiny population of about 350,000 nationals living under conservative <MISC> Islamic </MISC> rule . 

Its role in the region dwarfs its population , including giving financial and military support to the war on Gaddafi . 

Since the fall of <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> on Aug. 23 , <PER> Sallabi </PER> has emerged as a prominent spokesman for groups of <MISC> Islamists </MISC> unhappy about what they see as attempts by some <ORG> NTC </ORG> leaders to exclude them from political life . 

It was not clear whether he was back in <LOC> Libya </LOC> permanently or would return to his temporary base in <LOC> Qatar </LOC> . 

<PER> Sallabi </PER> , who was jailed by Gaddafi in the 1980s for opposition activities , said that though <MISC> Islam </MISC> and politics could not be separated in <LOC> Libya </LOC> , he had earned his public voice only because he was a <MISC> Libyan </MISC> citizen . 

¡° I believe that <MISC> Islam </MISC> covers all , including politics , ¡± he said . 

In the past we were deprived from implementing the principles of <MISC> Islam </MISC> . 

I am a religious person , I am also a <MISC> Libyan </MISC> citizen . 

I have my say with regard to the political issue . ¡± 

Several members of the crowd ¡ª some of them <MISC> Islamic </MISC> scholars ¡ª <PER> berated Al </PER> - <PER> Sallabi </PER> , telling him that religious leaders had no place in politics . 

The <MISC> Islamists </MISC> are a political group that has used the religion as a reference and turned it into an ideology , ¡± <PER> Faraj Aby Al </PER> - <PER> Esha </PER> , a longtime critic of <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> who has also recently returned to the country , told Al - <PER> Sellabi </PER> . 

¡° The political game depends on lies , conspiracies , and deception . 

Forcing religion into this game is a serious issue . ¡± 

The <ORG> NTC </ORG> has been at pains to assure its Western allies that <LOC> Libya </LOC> will not become a centre of militancy now that anti - <MISC> Islamist </MISC> leader <PER> Gaddafi </PER> has gone . 

Its leaders say they will hold elections and build a <MISC> democratic </MISC> society , which though based on <MISC> Islamic </MISC> law , will respect civil and individual rights . 

Several <MISC> Libyan </MISC> analysts say they are worried fault lines are opening up between the <MISC> Islamist </MISC> - run <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> Military Council , which has nominal control over the city and is also believed to be backed by <LOC> Qatar </LOC> , and groups loyal to interim Prime Minister <PER> Mahmoud Jibril </PER> , a Western - trained technocrat who Al - <PER> Sallabi </PER> has called on to resign . 

<ORG> Al </ORG> - <PER> Sallabi </PER> told the meeting he had lambasted <PER> Jibril </PER> only because of his ¡° professional capabilities and performance ¡± , not because he did not share his religious views .

The <ORG> Buffalo Bills </ORG> fought off a determined <ORG> Philadelphia </ORG> comeback bid to claim a 31 - 24 win on Sunday and send the <ORG> Eagles </ORG> to a fourth consecutive defeat . 

<ORG> Buffalo </ORG> cashed in on <LOC> Philadelphia </LOC> mistakes scoring touchdowns off two of quarterback <PER> Michael Vick </PER> ¡¯s four interceptions in improving their record to 4 - 1 . 

Dubbed the Dream Team in the preseason because of some big - name free - agent signings , the <ORG> Eagles </ORG> have endured a nightmare start with their only victory coming over winless <ORG> St. Louis </ORG> in their season - opener . 

Once again , the <ORG> Eagles </ORG> contributed to their own demise , particularly in a sloppy opening half littered with turnovers , costly penalties , bad decisions and poor tackling . 

The miscues added up to a 28 - 7 third quarter deficit , a hole they were unable to climb out as furious late rally fizzled . 

¡° We were trying to confuse <PER> Michael </PER> , trying to keep him off balance , ¡± <ORG> Buffalo </ORG> coach <PER> Chan Gailey </PER> told reporters . 

You ca n¡¯t sit there and do one or two things against him and expect to slow him down . 

¡° When you get five turnovers and you do n¡¯t turn it over but once , and the turnover that we gave them , they ended up coming out with nothing right before the half ... 

you get 5 - 1 ( turnover ratio ) , you give yourself a great chance to win . ¡± 

<ORG> Buffalo </ORG> quarterback <PER> Ryan Fitzpatrick </PER> completed 21 passes for 193 yards , including a six - yard touchdown to <PER> David Nelson </PER> . 

<PER> Fred Jackson </PER> and <PER> Brad Smith </PER> also ran for scores . 

Despite the turnovers it was a record breaking afternoon for <PER> Vick </PER> who ran for 90 yards to claim the <MISC> National Football League </MISC> ¡¯s quarterback career rushing record with 4,948 yards , eclipsing the old mark held by former <ORG> Philadelphia </ORG> quarterback <PER> Randall Cunningham </PER> . 

<PER> Vick </PER> , who signed a six - year $ 100 million deal prior to the start of the season , completed 26-of-40 passes for 315 yards passing and touchdowns to <PER> LeSean McCoy </PER> and <PER> Jeremy Maclin </PER> but his day ¡¯s work also included a career worst four pickoffs . 

¡° Sitting at 1 - 4 , there ¡¯s really not too much you can say , whether you ¡¯re a good team or a bad team , ¡± said <PER> Vick </PER> . 

As a quarterback an interception is an interception . 

Regardless of how you look at it , the world is going to judge you as throwing an interception . 

Two of those interceptions came is the opening quarter , the Bills converting the first into a five - yard <PER> Jackson </PER> touchdown to the delight of a capacity sun - bathed crowd of over 70,000 at <PER> Ralph Wilson </PER> Stadium . 

The <ORG> Eagles </ORG> finally got on the scoreboard early in the second , <PER> Vick </PER> connecting with a wide <MISC> open </MISC> Maclin for his 100th career touchdown pass , but the Bills came right back <PER> Fitzpatrick </PER> answering with 77-yard drive capped by a six - yard pass to <PER> Nelson </PER> . 

The next possession , <PER> Vick </PER> was off target again intercepted by <PER> Nick Barnett </PER> who returned it 31 yards for a 21 - 7 <ORG> Buffalo </ORG> halftime lead . 

The Bills roared out of the break , <PER> Fitzpatrick </PER> marching his team 80 yards for the score , <PER> Smith </PER> diving over from the five . 

Unable to get much done with his arm , <PER> Vick </PER> did it with his feet scrambling 53 yards to set up a 10 yard <PER> McCoy </PER> touchdown run . 

The Bills continued to cash in on <LOC> Philadelphia </LOC> mistakes , converting a <PER> Jason Avant </PER> fumble into a 25-yard <PER> Rian Lindell </PER> field goal for a 31 - 14 lead heading into the final quarter . 

But Eagles¡¯ big playmakers began to step up in the fourth , <PER> Jackson </PER> taking a short pass from Vick and weaving his way 31 yards into the end zone . 

<PER> Alex Henery </PER> would follow with a 35-yard field goal with over nine minutes still to play but the <ORG> Eagles </ORG> would get no closer , <PER> Barnett </PER> grabbing his second interception to snuff out <ORG> Philadelphia ¡¯s </ORG> last scoring chance .

<PER> Donald Tusk </PER> will be the first <MISC> Polish </MISC> prime minister since the fall of communism in 1989 to rule for two successive terms after his center - right Civic Platform trounced its rivals in a parliamentary election . 

An exit poll showed <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s pro - business party had won nearly 40 percent of votes in Sunday ¡¯s election , short of an absolute majority but far ahead of <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s nationalist - conservative <ORG> Law and Justice party </ORG> on just over 30 percent . 

Financial markets will welcome <PER> Tusk </PER> ¡¯s victory , which points to four more years of relative political and economic stability in the <ORG> European Union </ORG> ¡¯s largest eastern member state at a time of deepening crisis in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone . 

Final official results are not expected until Tuesday evening , but a jubilant <PER> Tusk </PER> swiftly claimed victory and <PER> Kaczynski </PER> conceded defeat . 

Projections based on the exit poll , conducted by <ORG> TNS OBOP </ORG> for national television , showed that <ORG> PO </ORG> and its preferred coalition partner , the <ORG> Peasants¡¯ Party </ORG> ( <ORG> PSL </ORG> ) , would together have enough seats to win a majority in the Sejm lower house . 

The leader of the rural - based <ORG> PSL </ORG> , <PER> Waldemar Pawlak </PER> , signaled he was ready to forge a new coalition with <PER> Tusk </PER> . 

¡° The ruling party and coalition for the first time in <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s post - communist history has been re - elected and that shows the consolidation of democracy in <LOC> Poland </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Jacek Raciborski </PER> , a political scientist at <LOC> Warsaw </LOC> University . 

¡° Only the low turnout is worrying , ¡± he added . 

About one in two eligible voters took part in the election , in which a return to power by <PER> Kaczynski </PER> which would have threatened relations with <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> Russia </LOC> and worried investors . 

The <ORG> PAP </ORG> state news agency quoted a senior <ORG> PO </ORG> politician as saying <PER> Tusk </PER> and <PER> Pawlak </PER> might yet fall short of a majority and that Civic Platform might also try to lure members of the <ORG> Democratic Left Alliance </ORG> ( <ORG> SLD </ORG> ) into a new coalition . 

The <ORG> SLD </ORG> , heir to the once - <ORG> mighty Communist Party </ORG> , won a surprisingly poor 7.7 percent , according to the exit poll , while <PER> Pawlak </PER> ¡¯s PSL secured 8.2 percent . 

The outgoing coalition has presided over four years of strong economic growth , steering <LOC> Poland </LOC> smoothly through the 2008 - 09 global financial crisis without dipping into recession . 

Its victory ends a string of defeats for ruling parties in elections in <ORG> EU </ORG> member states this year , including in <LOC> Portugal </LOC> , <LOC> Latvia </LOC> , <LOC> Denmark </LOC> and <LOC> Ireland </LOC> . 

<PER> PO </PER> has pledged more cautious reforms aimed at reining in the public debt and budget deficit , expected to reach 53.8 percent and 5.6 percent respectively this year . 

It also wants to continue a privatisation programme set to net 15 billion zlotys ( $ 4 billion ) for state coffers in 2011 and to pursue closer ties with <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> EU </ORG> partners . 

<MISC> Polish </MISC> President <PER> Bronislaw Komorowski </PER> , a former Civic Platform lawmaker , is now expected to ask <PER> Tusk </PER> to form a government 

but he said he must first wait for the official election results , expected on Tuesday evening . 

I hope that it will be possible to reduce the time necessary for creating the government ... to a minimum , ¡± <PER> Komorowski </PER> said on Sunday evening . 

The result is a personal triumph for <PER> Tusk </PER> , 54 , a pragmatic liberal conservative from near <LOC> Gdansk </LOC> on <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s 

<MISC> Baltic </MISC> coast who was involved in the Solidarity movement that helped end decades of communist rule . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> , whose country holds the <ORG> EU </ORG> presidency until the end of this year , favours closer integration with the rest of the bloc and says joining the <MISC> euro </MISC> remains a strategic goal for <LOC> Poland </LOC> despite the debt crisis in the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone . 

<PER> Tusk </PER> has good personal ties with <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and has maintained a cautious rapprochement with <LOC> Russia </LOC> , despite strains over a plane crash there last year that killed then - President <PER> Lech Kaczynski </PER> , <PER> Jaroslaw Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s twin . 

A government led by <PER> Kaczynski </PER> , 62 , would have been likely to strain <LOC> Poland </LOC> ¡¯s relations with its two large neighbours , <LOC> Russia </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> , as happened when Law and Justice was last in power from 2005 to 2007 . 

<PER> Kaczynski </PER> ¡¯s calls for a halt to privatisation , for higher taxes on the wealthy and for a more combative stance in dealings with the <ORG> EU </ORG> had also unsettled investors . 

The main surprise of this election was the rise of a new liberal grouping , <PER> Palikot </PER> ¡¯s Movement , which the exit poll showed winning 10.1 percent , much of it at the expense of the former communists . 

<PER> Janusz Palikot </PER> , its founder , is a wealthy businessman and former <ORG> PO </ORG> lawmaker whose attacks on the powerful <MISC> Roman Catholic </MISC> Church and championing of causes such as gay rights and legalisation of soft drugs struck a chord among young voters . 

<MISC> Libyan </MISC> transitional government forces attacked deposed leader <PER> Muammar Gaddafi </PER> ¡¯s security headquarters in the center of his hometown of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , hoping that once the buildings had been captured the fight for the city would be won . 

The protracted battle for <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , a showpiece Mediterranean coastal city largely loyal to <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> , has led to concerns the many civilian casualties will breed long - term hostility that will make it very hard for the <ORG> National Transitional Council </ORG> ( <ORG> NTC </ORG> ) to unite the country once the fighting is over . 

<ORG> NTC </ORG> forces have repeatedly claimed to be on the point of victory in <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , only to suffer sudden reversals at the hands of a tenacious enemy fighting for its life , surrounded on three sides and with its back to the sea . 

But as night fell Sunday , pick - up trucks mounted with anti - aircraft guns pounded the white security buildings on a tree - lined square with a fountain in the center while infantry blasted away with AK-47s from behind a high concrete wall , <ORG> Reuters </ORG> witnesses said . 

One of the pick - up gunners was shot in the face , his gun rotating repeatedly on its axis as he fell dead to the ground . 

¡° We are now in the center of <LOC> Sirte </LOC> , ¡± 

Colonel <PER> Salam Al Shalmany </PER> told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> at the scene . 

They are in these buildings about half a kilometre from where we are . 

But advances by <ORG> NTC </ORG> forces have often proved fragile . 

Earlier Sunday , a large group of fighters , approaching <LOC> Sirte </LOC> from the west and trying to pin down <LOC> Gaddafi </LOC> loyalists against the sea , saw their advance suddenly collapse into a rout under heavy and accurate mortar bombardment . 

Their trademark pick - up trucks raced to the rear , some running on flat tyres . 

One man with arm and leg wounds frantically limped away from the carnage as commanders screamed over the radios for their troops to pull back . 

Soon seven fighters lay dead in a field hospital while dozens more were being treated for shrapnel wounds . 

Elsewhere in the city , grown rich on 42 years of Gaddafi largesse , troops and residents still loyal to the former leader launched counter attacks after losing three landmark buildings ¡ª the hospital , the university and the lavish <LOC> Ouagadougou </LOC> center , built to host summits of foreign dignitaries . 

Despite the counter strikes , the buildings appeared to remain in <ORG> NTC </ORG> hands . 

But in just one field hospital to the east of the city , doctors said they had received 17 dead and 87 wounded in Sunday ¡¯s fighting . 

<ORG> NTC </ORG> chairman <PER> Abdel Jalil </PER> told a news conference in the capital <LOC> Tripoli </LOC> that his men had reached <LOC> Sirte </LOC> city center and were combing the town for snipers . 

The only other major Gaddafi - held town , <PER> Bani Walid </PER> , in the desert to the south , was also under siege from no fewer than five sides , he said . 

¡° I think and I hope , with the help of <PER> God </PER> , the liberation of these two towns will be completed by the end of this week . 

The prolonged struggle to capture <LOC> Sirte </LOC> and the other few remaining bastions of pro - <PER> Gaddafi </PER> loyalists has delayed <ORG> NTC </ORG> efforts to set up effective government and restart oil production , the lifeblood of the <MISC> Libyan </MISC> economy . 

<LOC> Sirte </LOC> holds symbolic significance because Gaddafi turned it from a fishing village into a second capital . 

He built opulent villas , hotels and conference halls to house the international summits he liked to stage there . 

Thousands of civilians have fled <LOC> Sirte </LOC> as fighting has intensified , describing increasingly desperate conditions for those still inside the seafront city . 

There is no electricity while drinking water and food are running out .

said on Monday it had delayed launching a new smartphone based on <ORG> Google </ORG> ¡¯s latest version of Android operating system due to the death of <ORG> Apple ¡¯s co </ORG> - founder <PER> Steve </PER> Jobs . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> planned to introduce the new product based on Ice Cream Sandwich system , which will unite the Android software used in tablets and smartphones , at its Mobile Unpack event in <LOC> San Diego </LOC> on Tuesday . 

¡° We decided it was not the right time to announce a new product while the world was expressing tribute to <PER> Steve Jobs¡¯ </PER> passing , ¡± a <ORG> Samsung </ORG> spokesman said . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> has yet to decide the new date for the release , the spokesman said . 

Jobs death on Wednesday , following a years - long battle with pancreatic cancer , sparked an outpouring of tributes from world leaders , business rivals and fans . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> is the biggest maker of mobile phones based on Android , which is available for free to handset vendors such as <ORG> Motorola Mobility </ORG> and <ORG> HTC Corp </ORG> .

<ORG> Samsung Electronics Co </ORG> said on Monday it had delayed the launch of a new smartphone based on <ORG> Google </ORG> ¡¯s latest version of Android operating system while the world paid tribute following the death of <ORG> Apple co </ORG> - founder <PER> Steve </PER> Jobs . 

The delay also comes as intensifying legal battle between <ORG> Apple </ORG> and <ORG> Samsung </ORG> is set to reach the most crucial moment this week , with the two technology <ORG> giants </ORG> set to meet in courtrooms in the <LOC> United States </LOC> , the <LOC> Netherlands </LOC> , <LOC> Australia </LOC> , <LOC> South Korea </LOC> and <LOC> Japan </LOC> .

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> has yet to decide on a new date for the release , the spokesman said . 

Jobs died on Wednesday following a years - long battle with pancreatic cancer , and tributes from world leaders , business rivals and fans have poured in since . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> and <ORG> Apple </ORG> are suing each other in 10 countries over 20 cases since April , but few of them holding as much significance as the <ORG> California court </ORG> ruling on Thursday , since it could affect <ORG> Samsung </ORG> ¡¯s mobile device sales in the <LOC> United States </LOC> , one of its biggest markets . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> said it has no plan to delay scheduled hearing dates due to Jobs ¡¯s death . 

Less than a day before his death on Wednesday , <ORG> Samsung </ORG> widened its patent - infringement cases with the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> firm to ban the sale of <ORG> Apple </ORG> ¡¯s new iPhone in <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Italy </LOC> after a series of setbacks in <LOC> Australia </LOC> and <LOC> Europe </LOC> . 

<ORG> Apple </ORG> says <ORG> Samsung </ORG> ¡¯s <ORG> Galaxy </ORG> line of mobile phones and tablets ¡° slavishly ¡± copied its iPhone and iPad . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> rejects the claims and argue the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> firm infringed on its mobile patents . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> is the most credible challenger to <ORG> Apple </ORG> . 

It said on Friday its quarterly profit should top the most bullish market forecasts , with smartphones becoming its main profit engine despite intense competition from bigger rival <ORG> Apple </ORG> . 

<ORG> Apple </ORG> unveiled its latest iPhone last week , leaving investors and fans wishing for more than a souped - up version of last year ¡¯s device at a time of heightened competition from rival smartphone makers . 

But <LOC> U.S. </LOC> mobile carrier <ORG> AT&T </ORG> said on Friday it has seen ¡° extraordinary demand ¡± for the new iPhone with over 200,000 pre - orders in the first 12 hours . 

Last week , <ORG> Apple </ORG> rejected an offer from <ORG> Samsung </ORG> to settle a tablet computer dispute in <LOC> Australia </LOC> , possibly killing off the commercial viability of the <ORG> new Galaxy </ORG> tablet in that market .

<ORG> China Nickel Resources Holdings Co Ltd </ORG> said on Sunday it would buy an 80 percent equity stake in <MISC> Indonesian </MISC> iron - nickel ore firm <ORG> PT Yiwan </ORG> Mining for HK$2.067 billion ( $ 266 million ) in a bid to secure supply of nickel - iron ores and mineral resources . 

The <MISC> Chinese </MISC> integrated mineral resources , nickel and special steel maker said in a statement that HK$1.907 billion of the acquisition costs would be settled by the issue of convertible notes . 

The actual consideration of the acquisition is subject to adjustments and that the final valuation of Yiwan Mining could be as much as a maximum of HK$3.1 billion , it added .

For the last few years , a widely circulated joke about <PER> Jerry Yang </PER> was that he had the best tan in <LOC> Silicon Valley </LOC> from all the time he spent on <LOC> Stanford University ¡¯s golf </LOC> course . 

But the jests stopped about six months ago , when the <ORG> Yahoo Inc co </ORG> - founder and former CEO put away his golf clubs and began showing up on a daily basis at the <MISC> Internet </MISC> company ¡¯s headquarters in <LOC> Sunnyvale </LOC> , <LOC> California </LOC> , according to a high - ranking <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> executive . 

Now , Yang is interested in a deal with private equity firms that would take the $ 20 billion company off public markets , according to people familiar with the situation . 

Such a deal would involve rolling over Yang ¡¯s stake in <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , which stood at 3.63 percent as of April 2 . 

<ORG> Yahoo ¡¯s other co </ORG> - founder , <PER> David Filo </PER> , would likely follow Yang ¡¯s lead and roll over his stake , said other sources close to <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> . 

<ORG> Filo </ORG> held 5.90 percent of <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s shares as of May 11 . 

Shortly after firing <PER> Carol Bartz </PER> as CEO in September , <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> and its longtime advisers at <ORG> Allen & Co </ORG> and <ORG> Goldman Sachs </ORG> began working on a strategic review , which could include a sale of the <MISC> Internet </MISC> pioneer , after receiving unsolicited expressions of interest . 

<PER> Jack Ma </PER> , CEO of <MISC> Chinese </MISC> e - commerce giant <ORG> Alibaba </ORG> , said last month that he would be ¡° very interested ¡± in buying <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , a deal that could help the former <MISC> English </MISC> school teacher expand into the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> 

<ORG> Microsoft Corp </ORG> is also considering bidding for <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , as is Silver <ORG> Lake Partners </ORG> , <ORG> Providence Equity Partners </ORG> and <ORG> Hellman & Friedman </ORG> , <ORG> Reuters </ORG> reported last week . 

Another private firm that has expressed interest in <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> is <ORG> Bain Capital </ORG> , a source said . 

<PER> Bain </PER> has invested heavily in several media companies including Clear Channel Communications and The Weather Channel in recent years . 

A <ORG> Bain </ORG> spokesman declined to comment . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> declined to detail Yang ¡¯s current role other than to say , ¡° The entire Board , including <PER> Jerry </PER> , is fully aligned and unanimous in support of the comprehensive scope of the ongoing strategic review . 

As always , <PER> Jerry ¡¯s </PER> singular focus remains to serve the best interests of <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡ª its shareholders , employees , users and advertisers . 

Three years ago , <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> offered $ 33 per share , or $ 47.5 billion , to acquire <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> . 

Yang and the board turned down that bid , to the regret of many shareholders . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s shares closed at $ 15.47 on Friday . 

Now <PER> Yang </PER> , who turns 43 in November , finds himself in essentially the same spot ¡ª trying to resuscitate an organization where a lack of operational vision and clear leadership has made it susceptible to a takeover . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s share of the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> <MISC> Internet </MISC> search market stood at 16 percent in August , compared with 19 percent two years ago , according to <ORG> ComScore </ORG> , despite a deal to outsource search technology to <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> . 

In contrast , <ORG> Google Inc </ORG> ¡¯s search share has been steady at 65 percent , while <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> ¡¯s share rose to 15 percent from 9 percent two years ago . 

<ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s <LOC> U.S. </LOC> display ad impressions fell to 10.2 percent in June , and time spent by users on its site increased just 1.6 percent for the 12 months ended July 2011 , according to <ORG> ComScore </ORG> . 

By comparison , Facebook ¡¯s ad impressions swelled to 32.4 percent in June 2011 and time spent by users on its site jumped 58 percent for the 12 months ended July 2011 . 

<ORG> Yahoo ¡¯s advisors </ORG> are expected to send financial information this week to interested parties , said a person familiar with the matter . 

Talks so far have been informal and have not firmed up on terms that would compel Yahoo to enter into direct negotiations , said another source . 

There are several reasons why Yang might want to take Yahoo private . 

For starters , <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> is punished by <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> for not being a growth company and its low stock price prevents shares from being used as currency for acquisitions . 

A buyer could sell off <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s international assets , which include a partnership with <ORG> Softbank </ORG> in <ORG> Yahoo Japan </ORG> as well as about 40 percent stake in <ORG> Alibaba </ORG> . 

The buyer could then use the cash ¡ª estimated to be upward of $ 12 billion ¡ª to pay off debt . 

That would pare down Yahoo to its <LOC> U.S. </LOC> operations , which has deteriorated to the point that they are being valued at just $ 5 billion and $ 6 billion , according to two sources close to the situation . 

Whether Yang will succeed in taking Yahoo private remains to be seen ¡ª it depends on the terms he manages to negotiate , as well as what other offers are on the table . 

Yang still exerts influence over the board , but he has less clout with <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> management and staff now than he did during the talks with <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> , according to current and former employees . 

Executives most loyal to Yang have matriculated out of the company over the years , replaced by a younger generation . 

Moreover , some detractors hold Yang responsible for refusing <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> in 2008 , saying his decision was influenced by his personal attachment to <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> , rather than financial considerations . 

¡° The <ORG> Microsoft </ORG> decision really split the company , with many feeling that <PER> Jerry ¡¯s </PER> decision was bad for them personally because he left a lot of money on the table , ¡± said a former executive who worked at <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> at the time of the offer . 

Nevertheless , Yang still retains pockets of support inside the company . 

His supporters say he has a deep concern for the direction and culture of the business he founded with <ORG> Filo </ORG> in 1995 . 

They praised Yang for stepping in again to try to lift <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> ¡¯s fortunes at a difficult juncture , just as he did in 2007 when he assumed the CEO role from <PER> Terry Semel </PER> . 

<PER> Yang </PER> also has a deep network of contacts in the industry and a reputation for actively working behind the scenes . 

¡° He ¡¯d be in the office , the door would be closed , he ¡¯d be working the phones , but you would n¡¯t know who he ¡¯d be working them with , ¡± said another former <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> executive who worked closely with Yang . 

The Business Insider blog reported in September that Yang was trying to buy <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> . 

<PER> Yang </PER> , whose quiet speech and calm demeanor belie a fiercely competitive streak , has a better chance of remaining involved with <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> in a management - led buyout than an outright sale . 

But private equity firms also like to install their own management at companies they acquire . 

In pushing a go - private agenda , Yang appears to be hoping that his knowledge of <ORG> Yahoo </ORG> will be enough to convince a buyer to allow him to stay on and try to restore the company to its former glory , away from the harsh eyes of <LOC> Wall Street </LOC> .

<LOC> WINNIPEG </LOC> , <LOC> Manitoba </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> welcomed back its beloved Jets on Sunday , as the <MISC> National Hockey League </MISC> returned to the <MISC> western Canadian </MISC> city 15 years after its heartbreaking exit . 

The <ORG> Montreal Canadiens </ORG> beat the Jets 5 - 1 in <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> ¡¯s first game of the NHL regular season , but the result was hardly the point as the <LOC> Manitoba </LOC> provincial capital reclaimed what it once lost to poor economics . 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> ¡¯s True North Sports and Entertainment , led by local businessman <PER> Mark Chipman </PER> and <ORG> Thomson Reuters Corp </ORG> chairman <PER> David Thomson </PER> , bought the money - losing <ORG> Atlanta Thrashers </ORG> after last season and moved them north to become <LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s seventh team in the 30-team NHL . 

<PER> Derrick Edmundson </PER> , 55 , watched the last Jets game in 1996 and did n¡¯t expect to see the NHL return any time soon after the team moved to <LOC> Phoenix </LOC> , <LOC> Arizona </LOC> to become the <ORG> Coyotes </ORG> . 

¡° To have them back in our generation is unbelievable , ¡± he said . 

We ¡¯re in the center of the <MISC> hockey universe </MISC> today - how fun is that ? ¡± 

Although <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> , population 695,000 , was devastated to lose the Jets , the loss was a turning point , co - owner <PER> Chipman </PER> . 

The city built new sports facilities and its manufacturing , farming and mining economy grew steadily . 

I tell people how it happened , ¡± <PER> Chipman </PER> said of the return . 

I ¡¯m not sure I can say why it happened . 

An enormous number of good things happened . 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> sold out its 13,000 season tickets in minutes last spring in a frenzy of anticipation . 

On Sunday , <LOC> jersey </LOC> - clad fans packed the <LOC> MTS Centre arena </LOC> and chanted ¡® Go Jets 

Go¡¯ hours before the opening faceoff , while nearby thousands of fans who could n¡¯t get tickets cheered the team on a giant TV screen . 

¡° I think everyone has taken note of the enthusiasm and the passion for our game , ¡± said NHL commissioner <PER> Gary Bettman </PER> , who was villified in <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> when the last team left . 

We have no reason to believe other than this team will be an absolute success . ¡± 

The <ORG> Canadiens </ORG> jumped to a 2 - 0 lead before <PER> Nik Antropov </PER> cut the lead in half with the first goal for the reborn Jets in the third period . 

<ORG> Montreal </ORG> put the game out of reach with three more goals .

The talks stalled during negotiations on a counter - proposal submitted by Eagle , the report said .

Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Flight attendants at <LOC> Air Canada </LOC> 

have rejected a tentative labor contract with the country ¡¯s biggest airline , and also served notice of their intension to strike on October 13 . 

The <ORG> Canadian Union of Public Employees </ORG> ( <ORG> CUPE </ORG> ) , which represents 6,800 flight attendants at <LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s biggest airline , said 65.2 percent of its members who cast their ballots over the past 10 days voted against the agreement . 

¡° We ask the federal government , in the strongest possible terms , to respect our right to collective bargaining and not intervene unilaterally in this dispute , ¡± <PER> Jeff Taylor </PER> , president of <ORG> CUPE ¡¯s Air Canada component </ORG> , said in a statement . 

Union leaders had urged members to back the tentative labor agreement , which was reached on September 20 just hours before a strike , which would have grounded much of the airline ¡¯s fleet , was set to start . 

Union members overwhelmingly rejected a previous labor contract with <ORG> Air Canada </ORG> in August . 

Negotiations resumed after the rejection but the union issued 72-hour strike notice when talks stalled .. 

<LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s Conservative government has made it clear that it will step in swiftly with back - to - work legislation to halt any strikes at <LOC> Air Canada </LOC> , which it regards as an important engine of economic activity . 

Last month Labour Minister <PER> Lisa Raitt </PER> said a strike at <LOC> Air Canada </LOC> could strand as many as 65,000 passengers on its first day .

By his own stated benchmark at the start of the week , <ORG> Tiger Woods </ORG> did not enjoy a successful <MISC> Frys.com Open </MISC> though he was happy with his day - by - day progress at CordeValle Golf Club . 

Playing in his first <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> event in almost two months after an injury - hit season of erratic form , the former world number one signed off with a three - under - par 68 in Sunday ¡¯s final round , his third successive score in the 60s . 

However , <PER> Woods </PER> had said on the eve of the tournament he would be satisfied with nothing less than victory in the second - tier <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> event and he ended the week in a tie for 30th , a distant 10 strokes off the pace . 

¡° I got better every day , ¡± the 14-times major champion told reporters after posting a seven - under total of 277 on another sun - splashed day at CordeValle where the average score was 69.21 in the final round . 

Unfortunately , there were a couple of times where I kind of did n¡¯t get the momentum going when I had a couple of chances to make putts 

¡° I felt very comfortable , and I just need to keep staying the course . 

These are trying times , though , for the greatest player of his generation and arguably the best ever . 

<PER> Woods </PER> has been a shadow of his former dominant self since his private life unravelled at the end of 2009 and this week he was competing for the first time in a Fall Series event , at the urging of <LOC> U.S. </LOC> <MISC> Presidents Cup </MISC> captain <PER> Fred Couples </PER> . 

He was selected by <PER> Couples </PER> as one of two wildcard picks on the 12-man team to take on the Internationals in <LOC> Melbourne </LOC> from November 17 - 20 , despite having played only eight events this year . 

However , <PER> Woods </PER> never felt he had to validate his <MISC> Cup </MISC> selection in this week ¡¯s event , saying he was simply focused on trying to win a golf tournament . 

¡° I ¡¯m just playing to get competitive , ¡± said the 35-year - old <MISC> American </MISC> , who has not triumphed anywhere since the 2009 <MISC> Australian Masters </MISC> and has dropped to 51st in the rankings . 

It ¡¯s about going out there and playing ... understanding the situations and feels , and game time ¡¯s a little bit different . 

I really have n¡¯t played a whole lot since the Masters ( in April ) . 

For the second day in a row at CordeValle , <PER> Woods </PER> made a strong start after teeing off at the 10th , four birdies in his first six holes putting him five shots off the lead at eight under par . 

Though he bogeyed the par - three 16th after ending up in tangly rough to the right of the green off the tee , he birdied the drivable par - four 17th to reach the turn in four - under 32 . 

His momentum stalled as he bogeyed the second after failing to reach the green in two , and the fifth , where he missed the fairway badly to the left , to slide back to six under . 

¡° I could have just really got it rolling . 

I had a couple of opportunities like that , both yesterday and again today . 

But unfortunately it did n¡¯t happen that way . 

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <MISC> Euro </MISC> zone leaders must accept ¡° collective responsibility ¡± and take ¡° decisive steps ¡± to prevent economic disaster , <MISC> British </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> David Cameron </PER> said in an interview with the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> on Monday . 

He also called on <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> to bury their differences and to introduce a decisive plan to end the uncertainty before the end of the year . 

The situation with the world economy is very precarious ... 

you either make the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone work properly or you confront its potential failure , ¡± he said . 

<PER> Cameron </PER> urged <MISC> European </MISC> leaders to adopt a ¡° big bazooka ¡± approach to resolving the currency crisis , warning they have just a matter of weeks to avert economic disaster . 

<MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> said after talks on Sunday that a new comprehensive package for solving the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone debt crisis would be unveiled by the end of the month . 

<PER> Cameron </PER> also called for credible stress tests on <LOC> Europe </LOC> ¡¯s banks and said <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s banks , including <ORG> Royal Bank of Scotland </ORG> 

, would pass them ¡° if they are properly carried out ¡± . 

¡° They need to be tough , they need to pass the credibility test . 

Some of my fellow leaders complain that it ¡¯s all about markets and speculators , but none of us are proposing to change the market system . 

He said the next stress tests should be a model for sovereign debt writedowns and said the <MISC> British </MISC> government would ¡° do whatever is necessary 

¡± , which may include injecting more funds into <ORG> RBS </ORG> to bolster its core tier one capital ratio . 

Commenting on domestic issues , <PER> Cameron </PER> said government plans to bolster lending for small companies can be worked up ¡° relatively quickly ¡± , while he also endorsed the Bank of <LOC> England </LOC> ¡¯s decision to restart quantitative easing . 

On the issue of euroscepticism in his own party , voiced at last week ¡¯s Tory conference , <PER> Cameron </PER> said <ORG> EU </ORG> treaty reform should not be on the ¡° immediate agenda ¡± , but added that he feels it would be in <LOC> Britain </LOC> ¡¯s interest to retrieve some powers from <LOC> Brussels </LOC> . 

<MISC> Republican </MISC> <LOC> White House </LOC> hopeful <PER> Michele Bachmann </PER> , beset by falling poll numbers , staff departures and reports of fundraising troubles , on Sunday vowed to continue her campaign through the <LOC> New Hampshire </LOC> primary , which is likely to be in early January . 

Stumping in the early primary state for the first time since making her candidacy official in June , <PER> Bachmann </PER> kept up her attacks on President Barack Obama and urged <MISC> Republicans </MISC> not to compromise with a moderate nominee to oppose him . 

A new poll shows the <LOC> Minnesota Congresswoman </LOC> , a Tea Party favorite , tied for tenth in <LOC> New Hampshire </LOC> after peaking as high as second in June . 

<PER> Bachmann </PER> on Sunday mixed harsh rhetoric with humor as she campaigned in a state she has largely ignored in favor of <LOC> Iowa </LOC> , which is seen as more receptive to her conservative message . 

I want to be your sweetheart here in <LOC> New Hampshire </LOC> , ¡± she told a meeting of about 50 Tea Party supporters . 

¡° The thing that I would look forward to more than anything as the <MISC> Republican </MISC> nominee is taking Barack Obama on in the debates and holding him accountable for four years of destroying the country . 

<PER> Bachmann </PER> also took a veiled swipe at <MISC> Republican </MISC> frontrunner <PER> Mitt Romney </PER> as she campaigned in <LOC> Moultonborough </LOC> , on the <LOC> shores of Lake Winnipesaukee </LOC> , about 20 miles from <LOC> Romney </LOC> ¡¯s vacation home in <LOC> Wolfeboro </LOC> . 

Polls since 2009 have given former <LOC> Massachusetts </LOC> governor Romney a wide lead in the state among <MISC> Republican </MISC> hopefuls . 

¡° It ¡¯s not good enough to settle for anyone but Barack Obama , ¡± she said . 

This is the election where we have to have a constitutional conservative . ¡± 

Still , <PER> Bachmann </PER> , an outspoken evangelical <MISC> Christian </MISC> and social conservative , came to the defense of <ORG> Romney </ORG> ¡¯s Mormon faith , which was criticized by an evangelical pastor at a conservative conference in <LOC> Washington </LOC> on Friday . 

<LOC> Texas </LOC> pastor <PER> Robert Jeffress </PER> , who introduced and endorsed <LOC> Texas </LOC> Governor <PER> Rick Perry </PER> at the Value Voters meeting , told voters to choose a candidate other than Romney , and later told reporters that <PER> Mormonism </PER> was a ¡° cult . ¡± 

¡° We do n¡¯t have a test for people when they go into the <LOC> White House </LOC> , ¡± said <PER> Bachmann </PER> , who often espouses her evangelical beliefs while campaigning . 

We do believe in tolerance and liberty for all <MISC> Americans </MISC> . ¡± 

<PER> Bachmann </PER> said the long summer debate over raising the federal government ¡¯s borrowing limit had kept her away from <LOC> New Hampshire </LOC> . 

I wish I could have come back earlier 

but I was fighting the debt ceiling all summer , ¡± she said . 

<PER> Bachmann </PER> ¡¯s poll numbers peaked over the summer in the run - up to her victory in the <LOC> Iowa </LOC> straw poll , but have been falling since <PER> Perry </PER> ¡¯s entry into the race in August and most recently with the rise of pizza magnate <PER> Herman Cain </PER> . 

Since September her campaign manager and <PER> pollster </PER> have resigned and a number of <LOC> Iowa </LOC> campaign staff have returned to her congressional office staff . 

Reports suggest her campaign raised less than $ 5 million in the third quarter of the year , well below the levels raised by <PER> Romney </PER> and <PER> Perry </PER> . 

The bad news has dented the confidence of even her core supporters . 

¡° I ¡¯m not sure <PER> Michele </PER> has a great chance , ¡± said <PER> Don Ewing </PER> , a Tea Party supporter from <PER> Meredith </PER> , <LOC> N.H. </LOC> , who said he was still deciding whether to support <PER> Bachmann </PER> or <PER> Cain </PER> . 

You have to support the people you think will do the best job .

At least 11 <MISC> Chinese </MISC> sailors were killed when their ships were attacked on the Mekong River between <LOC> Thailand </LOC> and <LOC> Myanmar </LOC> , the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> Foreign Ministry said , voicing concern about what media reports said appeared to be an assault by drug smugglers . 

The sailors were on two cargo ships attacked on Oct. 5 in the ¡° <MISC> Golden Triangle ¡± of the Mekong </MISC> , a region of Southeast <LOC> Asia </LOC> notorious for narcotic production , the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> Foreign Ministry said on its website ( <ORG> www.mfa.gov.cn </ORG> ) late on Sunday .

<MISC> Chinese </MISC> sailors had been attacked and killed on the river before , it added , without giving details . 

<LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s growing presence in <LOC> Asia </LOC> , <LOC> Africa </LOC> and other parts of the world has prompted attacks , kidnappings and hijackings , and the issue has become a sensitive one for <MISC> Chinese </MISC> officials , who do not want to appear weak in protecting nationals . 

<LOC> Beijing </LOC> has ¡° asked the countries concerned to take effective measures to strengthen protection of <MISC> Chinese </MISC> vessels and crew on the Mekong River ¡± , the <ORG> Foreign Ministry </ORG> said . 

Crew on another boat that witnessed the attack said eight or so armed men stormed the two ships , and in the days since <MISC> Thai </MISC> police have pulled bodies of the sailors from the river , said the <LOC> China </LOC> News Service . 

The attackers appeared to be drug smugglers who sought to use the seized ships to traffic narcotics , said the report , citing <MISC> Thai </MISC> media accounts .

Two major shareholders of <LOC> New Zealand </LOC> financial company <ORG> Pyne Gould Corp Ltd </ORG> have made a $ 55 million takeover offer for the company . 

A company associated with <PER> George Kerr </PER> , long time director and shareholder , and <LOC> U.S. </LOC> investment fund <LOC> Baker Street </LOC> , have offered NZ$0.33 a share , a 22 percent premium to the company ¡¯s pre - offer traded price .

¡° <ORG> PGC </ORG> is now a company more likely to reinvest its earnings in its assets with a patient seven years and beyond investment horizon , ¡± <PER> Kerr </PER> said in a letter to shareholders . 

He said the company would need capital injection , which would likely require calls on shareholders who have previously been in the company for income and dividends . 

¡° With the remaining PGC businesses focusing on growth rather than dividends , it is appropriate to give all shareholders the opportunity to sell their shares for cash . ¡± 

<ORG> PGC </ORG> shares gained 18.5 percent or 5 cents to NZ$0.32 after the offer . 

The entity being used the offer , <ORG> Australasian Equity Partners Fund Ltd </ORG> , said it already had undertakings for 37.5 percent of the company . 

<ORG> PGC </ORG> sold its major asset , finance firm Marac into the Heartland banking operation , with the proceeds distributed to shareholders . 

It reported a full - year loss of NZ$141 million for the year to June caused by restructuring costs involving the set up of Heartland , asset writedowns and weak trading . 

It said it expected a modest trading profit this year . 

<ORG> PGC </ORG> now holds minor stakes in agribusiness <ORG> PGW Wrightson </ORG> 

, Heartland , and the impaired property assets from Marac . 

It said net asset backing at June 30 was NZ$0.60 a share . 

<LOC> Hong Kong </LOC> shares were set for a cautious start on Monday as investors await inflation and other economic data from <LOC> China </LOC> this week as <MISC> Chinese </MISC> markets reopen following Golden Week holidays . 

A pledge by leaders of <LOC> France </LOC> and <LOC> Germany </LOC> to unveil a comprehensive plan to solve the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s two - year - old debt crisis by the end of the month was seen supporting risky assets , but a dearth of details was likely to keep investors on edge . 

The <MISC> Hang Seng </MISC> index ended higher on Friday and up 9 percent from a 29-month low reached earlier in the week . 

The index closed up 0.7 percent for the week at 17,707 . 

Most gains came from short - covering , however , and foreign investors did not appear keen to chase the bounce off lows , with the biggest <LOC> China </LOC> - focused ETF traded in the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> , the <ORG> iShares FTSE China </ORG> 25 , ending down 1.3 percent on Friday . 

A slew of economic data from <LOC> China </LOC> , including September bank loans expected on Monday and monthly inflation for last month expected on Friday , will be closely watched to gauge the health of the economy . 

Fears of a possible ¡° hard landing ¡± in the world ¡¯s second - largest economy have roiled markets over the past couple of months , hitting banking , property and resources - related shares the most .

A former Miss <LOC> Iceland </LOC> who met <LOC> Boston </LOC> crime boss 

<PER> Whitey </PER> ¡± <PER> Bulger </PER> and his girl friend in <LOC> California </LOC> was paid a $ 2 million reward for the tip that led to <PER> Bulger </PER> ¡¯s arrest in June , the <ORG> Boston Globe </ORG> said on Sunday . 

The <ORG> Federal Bureau of Investigation </ORG> paid the reward money to <PER> Anna Bjornsdottir </PER> , a one - time model and Miss <LOC> Iceland </LOC> 1974 who had gotten to know <PER> Bulger </PER> ¡¯s girl friend <PER> Catherine Greig </PER> after the two women 

both took a shared interest in a local stray cat while the fugitive couple hid out in <LOC> Santa Monica </LOC> . 

<PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> had assumed new identities during more than a decade on the run from federal charges , and appeared to neighbors to be a modest retired couple . 

But it was Bjornsdottir , the newspaper reported , who recognized <PER> Bulger </PER> in a news report this summer while she was back in <LOC> Reykjavik </LOC> and called authorities . 

After the tip , <PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> were arrested in June without incident at their <LOC> Santa Monica </LOC> apartment building in June . 

Property records showed they moved into a two - bedroom unit in April 1998 , playing $ 863 a month . 

Authorities have said they found about 30 firearms and $ 822,000 in cash hidden in the walls of their apartment . 

The <ORG> FBI </ORG> had said in September it had paid $ 2.1 million to ¡° more than one individual ¡± for information that led to the arrests of <PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> , but had not given more detail . 

The newspaper reported <ORG> Bjornsdottir </ORG> had collected $ 2 million of the $ 2.1 million in <ORG> FBI </ORG> rewards for her tip . 

A spokesman for the <ORG> FBI ¡¯s Boston office </ORG> said he could not discuss people who gave the <ORG> bureau information </ORG> . 

<PER> Bulger </PER> had fled <LOC> Boston </LOC> after hearing from a corrupt FBI agent that he was about to be indicted . 

<PER> Greig </PER> joined him a short time later and has been charged with harboring <PER> Bulger </PER> as a fugitive . 

Past <LOC> Boston </LOC> FBI officials had used <PER> Bulger </PER> as an informant for years against other organized crime factions and , later investigations found , tolerated or enabled his own ongoing criminal activities in what an appeals court in a related case earlier this year termed an ¡° unholy alliance . ¡± 

<PER> Bulger </PER> , who for years led the <LOC> Boston </LOC> - based Winter <LOC> Hill Gang </LOC> , faces charges that include 19 alleged murders from the 1970s and 1980s . 

Both <PER> Bulger </PER> and <PER> Greig </PER> have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them . 

Through her husband , <PER> Bjornsdottir </PER> declined to speak to the Globe , the newspaper said . 

She had moved to Southern <LOC> California </LOC> in the late 1970 ¡¯s and appeared in cosmetics commercials . 

More recently she had befriended <PER> Greig </PER> after noticing her feeding a local cat , the paper reported . 

The newspaper described her currently as a ¡° 57-year - old yoga instructor and graphic designer . 

The Globe story also included many details of <PER> Bulger </PER> ¡¯s time on the run , including how <PER> Bulger </PER> assumed the identity of a local homelss man to obtain medicine and keep a bank account . 

Global banking regulators will press ahead with the first worldwide effort to force banks to hold more liquid assets , the chairman of the <ORG> Basel Committee on Banking Supervision </ORG> said in an interview with the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> on Monday . 

<PER> Stefan Ingves </PER> , who also heads the <MISC> Swedish </MISC> central bank , said the <ORG> Basel </ORG> group plans to put uniform implementation of the <LOC> Basel </LOC> III reforms at the top of its agenda . 

The measures , which will also force banks to cut back on short - term funding , have come under scrutiny from some of the 27 member countries who say the rule changes could damage the broader economy . 

The reforms , which were agreed to by the member states , will force banks to hold more top - quality capital against unexpected losses , but there are rising concerns that some countries will not stick to the agreement . 

¡° It is going to be all about implementation in as uniform a way as possible . 

Balkanisation of the rules over the long term is not in anyone ¡¯s interest , ¡± <PER> Ingves </PER> said . 

The FT reported that the committee plans to publish ¡° heat maps ¡± that show which countries are in compliance with the measures . 

The committee will also send out teams of experts to look at whether each country ¡¯s implementation laws and regulations are in accordance with the agreement . 

The <LOC> Basel </LOC> group is still hammering out the details on two liquidity rules : the liquidity coverage ratio , which would require banks to hold enough liquid assets to survive a 30-day crisis ; and the net stable funding ratio , which would force financial institutions to use more long - term funding . 

<LOC> TOKYO </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Japan </LOC> ¡¯s top oil <ORG> refiner </ORG> , <ORG> JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp </ORG> , said the 8,200 barrels per day lubricant oil manufacturing unit at its <ORG> Negishi </ORG> refinery near <LOC> Tokyo </LOC> caught fire around 6:30 p.m. 

( 0930 <MISC> GMT </MISC> ) on Sunday , but was extinguished by 8:55 p.m. 

The lube oil unit had been shut for a scheduled maintenance when the fire occurred in the heat - exchanger system , the wholly - owned unit of <ORG> JX Holdings </ORG> , said in a statement . 

The company said it would investigate the cause of the incident and rule out any repeat . 

The fire had no impact on the refinery ¡¯s other oil - processing units , including the two crude distillation units ( CDUs ) , a company official said . 

There is no change in the schedule to shut one of the CDUs , the 120,000 bpd No.1 unit , from Oct. 12 , for a planned maintenance , the official added .

The <ORG> Oakland Raiders </ORG> earned an emotional victory that would have delighted late owner <PER> Al Davis </PER> as they beat the <ORG> Houston Texans </ORG> 25 - 20 on Sunday while the <ORG> New Orleans Saints </ORG> and <LOC> New England </LOC> Patriots also enjoyed wins on the fifth week of the <MISC> National Football League </MISC> season . 

The outspoken <PER> Davis </PER> died at age 82 on Saturday but the <ORG> Raiders </ORG> , wearing ¡° <ORG> AL ¡± </ORG> stickers on their helmets , carried out his motto 

¡± as <PER> Michael Huff </PER> grabbed an interception off Texans quarterback <PER> Matt Schaub </PER> in the end zone on the final play . 

<ORG> Raiders </ORG> coach <PER> Hue Jackson </PER> buried his face in his hands on the sideline while players embraced each other as the game ended . 

<PER> Davis </PER> , who had almost 50 years with the <ORG> Raiders franchise </ORG> in various roles , was remembered with silence at stadiums across the country . 

¡° I know that he would be getting after me right now about the way we played , but he would be happy because we won the game , ¡± <PER> Jackson </PER> told reporters . 

¡° I know without a shadow of doubt that coach ( <PER> Davis </PER> ) is up there somewhere rejoicing because his football team did what he always said to do ¡ª commitment to excellence , pride and poise and just win . 

Once again <PER> Sebastian Janikowski </PER> was the spine of the win for the <ORG> Raiders </ORG> ( 3 - 2 ) , kicking four field goals , three of them from 50 yards or more . 

In an AFC East divisional clash , the <LOC> New England </LOC> Patriots , with <PER> BenJarvus Green </PER> - <PER> Ellis </PER> running for a career high 136 yards and two touchdowns , beat the <ORG> New York </ORG> Jets 30 - 21 . 

The victory was the 30th consecutive regular home win for <ORG> Patriots </ORG> quarterback <PER> Tom Brady </PER> , an NFL record . 

The <ORG> Carolina Panthers </ORG> , with rookie <PER> quarterback Cam Newton </PER> scoring three touchdowns ( one rushing ) and passing for 224 yards , pushed the Saints all the way before losing 30 - 27 . 

A <PER> Greg Olsen </PER> touchdown on a five - yard <PER> Newton </PER> pass put <LOC> Carolina </LOC> up 27 - 23 in the fourth but <LOC> New Orleans </LOC> came back with <PER> Drew Brees </PER> finding <PER> Pierre Thomas open </PER> on the right for the winning touchdown with 50 seconds to play 

Despite another encouraging display , the <ORG> Panthers </ORG> , who won just twice last year , fall to 1 - 4 . 

The <LOC> Buffalo </LOC> Bills¡¯ impressive start continued as they took advantage of four interceptions by <ORG> Philadelphia Eagles </ORG> quarterback <PER> Michael Vick </PER> in a 31 - 24 win . 

<PER> Fred Jackson </PER> rushed for 111 yards and a touchdown for the Bills and also had 85 yards receiving against an <ORG> Eagles </ORG> team ( 1 - 4 ) that , after being considered Super Bowl contenders in the pre - season , has now suffered four consecutive defeats .

<LOC> LONDON </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <ORG> Lloyds Banking Group </ORG> 

appears poised to take a loss of about 35 percent on a 1 billion pound ( $ 1.5 billion ) basket of commercial property debt as talks advance to sell the portfolio , the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> reported on Monday . 

The newspaper cited people familiar with the process as saying as the bank is entering second - round talks with four unnamed remaining bidders for the portfolio of properties . 

The sources cited in the article say <ORG> Lloyds </ORG> narrowed the field to four parties on Friday , each of which had tabled initial bids at almost 650 million pounds , a price that would represent a 35 percent discount to the loans¡¯ face values . 

Acceleration of the process means a sale could take place before Christmas , rather than next year as expected , with <ORG> Lloyds </ORG> hoping to unwind the 24 billion pounds worth of bad property loans it holds , according to the article . 

<PER> Moses Mosop </PER> of <LOC> Kenya </LOC> set a course record in cruising to victory in the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon on Sunday in a race tempered by the first death in the event in four years after a runner collapsed near the finish line . 

The runner , identified as <PER> William Caviness </PER> , 35 , by the <ORG> Cook County Medical Examiner ¡¯s office </ORG> , collapsed about 500 yards from completing the 26.2 mile course . 

He collapsed within 50 yards of doctors monitoring the race , who responded immediately but could not revive him and he was pronounced dead 1 hour and 45 minutes later at a local hospital , marathon spokeswoman <PER> Robin Monsky </PER> said . 

An autopsy has been scheduled for Monday . 

The last death in the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon occurred in 2007 , when temperatures climbed to 90 degrees F ( 32 C ) with high humidity . 

Some 300 runners were taken to hospital suffering from heat - related illness and the race was halted early . 

Conditions were milder this year with Sunday afternoon highs reaching only 73 degrees at a lake front gauge near <LOC> Grant Park </LOC> where the race started and finished , according to the <ORG> National Weather Service </ORG> . 

Marathon organizers reported transporting 54 individuals to area hospitals , down from 100 last year . 

Temperatures on the <LOC> Chicago lakefront </LOC> were in the mid-60s for the first two hours of the race and did not reach as high as expected through midday when the bulk of the runners were working their way through the city ¡¯s neighborhoods . 

Earlier in the day , Mosop surged away from an elite field of runners with seven miles to go , setting a course record of two hours five minutes and 37 seconds and waving to the crowd as he trotted toward the finish line . 

<PER> Liliya Shobukhova </PER> of <LOC> Russia </LOC> won the women ¡¯s competition for the third straight year in two hours eighteen minutes and 20 seconds , beating the second place women 

¡¯s finisher by nearly four minutes . 

Both winners¡¯ times were unofficial . 

<PER> Mosop </PER> , who had the second fastest marathon time on record in losing the <LOC> Boston </LOC> Marathon by 4 seconds earlier this year , quickly countered a breakaway by <PER> countryman Wesley Korir </PER> after the 19 mile mark and never looked back in breaking the course record set two years ago . 

<PER> Korir </PER> finished 38 seconds behind Mosop in second place . 

<PER> Bernard Kipyego </PER> of <LOC> Kenya </LOC> was third . 

In a post - race interview , <PER> Mosop </PER> said he had been prepared to challenge for a course record , but not the world record because a leg injury had limited his training . 

I ¡¯m very happy about my job today , ¡± <PER> Mosop </PER> said in the interview on <ORG> NBC </ORG> television , which carried the race . 

<PER> Ryan Hall </PER> , a pre - race favorite , finished fifth overall in 2:08:04 and was the top <MISC> American </MISC> . 

<PER> Hall </PER> ¡¯s was the third fastest <MISC> American </MISC> performance on record for the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon trailing only <PER> Khalid Khannouchi </PER> ¡¯s two wins in 2002 and 2000 . 

The <LOC> Chicago </LOC> marathon course is considered ideal for record - setting performances when conditions are right . 

The route cuts through two dozen ethnic neighborhoods between its start and finish in <LOC> Grant Park </LOC> adjacent to downtown . 

<ORG> Mosop </ORG> had the second fastest marathon in history in <LOC> Boston </LOC> at <LOC> 2:03:06 </LOC> , just behind <PER> Geoffrey Mutai </PER> of <LOC> Kenya </LOC> who set the marathon record at 2:03:02 . 

Partly because <LOC> Boston </LOC> is a point - to - point course and there was a strong tailwind , those times were not recognized as world records . 

The current world record in the marathon is 2:03:38 , set September 25 in <LOC> Berlin </LOC> by <LOC> Kenya </LOC> ¡¯s <PER> Patrick Makau </PER> . 

<PER> Shobukhova </PER> had the second fastest time ever for a woman in the <LOC> Chicago </LOC> Marathon behind <PER> Paula Radcliffe </PER> of Great <LOC> Britain </LOC> who set a then - world record of 2:17:18 in 2002 . 

<MISC> Ethiopian </MISC> track star <PER> Ejegayehu Dibaba </PER> , who was making her marathon debut , ran alongside <PER> Shobukhova </PER> until about the 15 mile mark before slipping off the pace . 

Some 45,000 runners were registered for the race with more than 100 countries represented . 

Race organizers expected some 1.7 million spectators to watch along the route . 

About 35,600 runners finished the race .

<ORG> Ladbrokes </ORG> may pull the plug on its potential takeover of <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> even if <ORG> Sportingbet </ORG> removes a perceived stumbling block to the deal by selling its <MISC> Turkish </MISC> business , the <ORG> Financial Times </ORG> reported on Monday .

Two sources told <ORG> Reuters </ORG> on Monday that <ORG> KDB </ORG> had begun looking into a possible takeover but had not made a final decision about whether to move forward . 

Local media earlier reported that <ORG> HSBC </ORG> plans to sell 11 retail branches across <LOC> South Korea </LOC> so as to concentrate on 

corporate and investment banking businesses . 

¡° It is hard to say , because this is a game that has a counterpart , ¡± <ORG> KDB </ORG> Chairman <PER> Kang </PER> Man - <PER> soo </PER> was quoted as saying in an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Sunday , referring to its potential takeover targets . 

¡° We can not comment on media rumours or speculation , ¡± said a <LOC> Seoul </LOC> - based spokeswoman at <ORG> HSBC </ORG> .

The <LOC> London </LOC> - based bank ¡¯s planned exit from retail banking in <LOC> Korea </LOC> comes amid a revamp plan launched by new Chief Executive <PER> Stuart Gulliver </PER> in May to lift profitability . 

<ORG> HSBC </ORG> ¡¯s <MISC> Korean </MISC> retail operations would be a nice fit with <ORG> KDB </ORG> , which is smaller and has fewer retail networks compared with big homegrown lenders such as <ORG> Kookmin Bank </ORG> and <ORG> Shinhan Bank </ORG> .

<LOC> Seoul </LOC> shares rose on Monday , led by technology issues and shipyards , after encouraging <LOC> U.S. </LOC> jobs data and as investors gained confidence that <LOC> Europe </LOC> was dealing with its debt crisis , with gains . 

The <LOC> Korea </LOC> <MISC> Composite Stock Price Index </MISC> ( KOSPI ) was up 0.64 percent to 1,771.11 points as of 0209 <MISC> GMT </MISC> , poised to gain for a third straight session . 

The market is drawing a buying appetite again , especially around exporters , ¡± said <PER> Lee Kyoung </PER> - <PER> soo </PER> , an analyst at <ORG> Shinyoung Securities </ORG> . 

Analysts said stronger - than - expected <LOC> U.S. </LOC> job data and progress seen in <LOC> Europe </LOC> were two factors helping to buoy sentiment . 

<LOC> U.S. </LOC> employers hired more workers than expected in September and job gains for the prior two months were revised higher , data showed on Friday . 

Markets were supported by news that the leaders of <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> had promised on Sunday to unveil a new comprehensive package for solving the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis by the end of the month . 

Institutions were buyers of a net 99.2 billion <MISC> Korean </MISC> won 

( $ 84.2 million ) worth of stocks , poised to pick up shares for a third session . 

Pension funds were buyers of a net 25.2 billion won , also set for a net purchase of shares for a third straight session . 

But even today ¡¯s recovery may be part of the market ¡¯s broader volatility . 

This may not be a longer - term upward trend , ¡± <PER> Lee </PER> added . 

Gains were led by technology issues and index heavyweights such as <ORG> Samsung Electronics </ORG> , which was up 2.3 percent , continuing to be helped by better - than - expected third quarter earnings estimates announced on Friday . 

Shares in <ORG> Hynix Semiconductor </ORG> , the world ¡¯s No.2 memory chip maker , climbed 2.1 percent . 

Shares in <ORG> Korea Gas Corp </ORG> rallied 5.5 percent after the government raised domestic gas rates by 5.3 percent on average in a move to reflect higher import costs of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) and help cut losses in state - <ORG> run Korea Gas Corp </ORG> ( <ORG> KOGAS </ORG> ) . 

The price hike is positive following previous price freezes , ¡± said <PER> Lee Chang </PER> - <PER> mok </PER> , an analyst at <ORG> Woori Investment & Securities </ORG> in a report . 

¡° This will make is easier for government to implement pricing measures that are reflective of raw material prices , ¡± <PER> Lee </PER> said . 

Sharp gains in <ORG> shipbuilders </ORG> also gave market help , as <ORG> Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering advanced </ORG> 4.5 percent and <ORG> Samsung </ORG> Heavy Industries rose 4.1 percent . 

<ORG> ¡° Shipbuilders </ORG> had vastly underperformed the broader market during the worst of <MISC> European </MISC> fears , and it seems they have become ripe for bargain hunting , ¡± said <PER> Lee Bong </PER> - <PER> jin </PER> , an analyst at <ORG> KTB Securities </ORG> . 

<ORG> Daewoo Shipbuilding </ORG> shares had fallen nearly 50 percent in the past three months as of Friday ¡¯s close , compared with a 19.3 percent loss of the broader KOSPI during same period . 

<ORG> Samsung </ORG> Heavy Industries had lost 43 percent .

<PER> Lim </PER> became <LOC> Singapore </LOC> ¡¯s first female minister in 2009 , when she held concurrent positions as Minister in the Prime Minister ¡¯s office and as Second Minister for Finance and Second Minister for Transport . 

The <ORG> Milwaukee Brewers </ORG> flexed their power - hitting muscles to claim a 9 - 6 comeback victory over the visiting <ORG> St. Louis Cardinals </ORG> on Sunday in the opener of the <MISC> National League Championship Series </MISC> . 

The <ORG> Brewers </ORG> fought back from a 5 - 2 deficit with a six - run , fifth - inning outburst against their Central Division rivals keyed by their celebrated sluggers . 

<PER> Ryan Braun </PER> and Prince Fielder provided the knockout blows with <PER> Braun </PER> belting a two - run double and Fielder following with a two - run home run off <ORG> St Louis </ORG> starter and loser <PER> Jaime Garcia </PER> that clanged off the wall beyond the bullpen in right - center . 

Shortstop <PER> Yuniesky Betancourt </PER> added another two - run homer for good measure off reliever <PER> Octavio Dotel </PER> as <ORG> Milwaukee </ORG> moved from a three - run deficit into a three - run lead . 

¡° That was a nice inning there , ¡± said <ORG> Milwaukee </ORG> manager <PER> Ron Roenicke </PER> . 

To score like we did there , that ¡¯s outstanding . 

¡° Brauny , you know , big double there , drive in two . 

Followed right behind it with the Prince homer . 

After Fielder crossed the plate , he and <PER> Braun </PER> did their elaborate version of some fancy shadow boxing . 

That ¡¯s the one - two punch , ¡± explained <PER> Braun </PER> . 

Game Two of the best - of - seven series will be played on Monday in <LOC> Milwaukee </LOC> with <PER> Shaun Marcum </PER> starting for the <ORG> Brewers </ORG> against <ORG> St. Louis </ORG> starter <PER> Edwin Jackson </PER> . 

<PER> Zack Greinke </PER> , a spotless 11 - 0 during the regular season at <LOC> Miller Park </LOC> , gave up six runs in six - plus innings of work in Sunday ¡¯s game but registered the win for the home - loving <ORG> Brewers </ORG> . 

<LOC> Milwaukee </LOC> , which had the best home - park record in <MISC> Major League Baseball </MISC> at 57 - 34 , won at home for the fourth time without a loss so far this postseason . 

While the <ORG> Brewers </ORG> lapped up the cheers of the raucous crowd , <ORG> Cardinals </ORG> manager <PER> Tony La Russa </PER> was left to ponder what went wrong for 25-year - old left - <PER> hander Garcia </PER> . 

¡° I thought we competed on the offensive side great all night . 

I wish we could average six runs a game for the rest of the series , ¡± said <PER> La Russa </PER> , before turning his thoughts to <PER> Garcia </PER> . 

¡° It was a weird inning , because he was really good , and then just three pitches , <LOC> bam </LOC> , <LOC> bam </LOC> , <LOC> bam </LOC> , it was gone , ¡± he said . 

Aware that there was no love lost between the Central champion <ORG> Brewers </ORG> and wild card <ORG> Cardinals </ORG> , who have feuded this past season , the umpire warned both benches in the first inning after Fielder was hit in the arm by a pitch following a massive home run by <PER> Braun </PER> that was measured at 463 feet . 

The burly , bearded Fielder had no hard feelings . 

He did n¡¯t mean to do it , just trying to come inside I guess , ¡± he said . 

Fortunately enough we won the game . 

It ¡¯s important because it ¡¯s our home field . 

We ¡¯ve got to do work at home , plus it ¡¯s always good to get the first game 

and hopefully we come out tomorrow and do the same . 

<PER> Braun </PER> ¡¯s two - run shot pushed the <ORG> Brewers </ORG> into the lead after <ORG> St. Louis </ORG> scored in their first at - bat when <PER> Matt Holliday </PER> singled home <PER> Jon Jay </PER> . 

A three - run home run in the fourth by <PER> David Freese </PER> lifted the <ORG> Cardinals </ORG> to a 4 - 2 lead and they added another run in the top of the fifth on an <MISC> RBI </MISC> - single by <PER> Lance Berkman </PER> before the <ORG> Brewers </ORG> came roaring back in their half of the fifth .

DAY.TO for <MISC> C$ </MISC> 2.2 billion ( $ 2.1 billion ) . 

The deal , which is more than double the closing price of Daylight ¡¯s closing price of <MISC> C$ </MISC> 4.59 on Friday , marks the latest energy sector deal between <LOC> China </LOC> and <LOC> Canada </LOC> . 

¡° The deal is too small to grow reserves for <ORG> Sinopec </ORG> , which has a market cap of over $ 80 billion .

<LOC> BEIJING </LOC> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - More than 100 million rural <MISC> Chinese </MISC> people will settle in towns and cities in the next decade , testing provision of welfare and services as a new generation of migrants turn their backs on farming , according to a new government report . 

The <ORG> National Population and Family Planning Commission </ORG> report forecast that by 2020 , <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s urban population would pass 800 million , and many of the new residents are rural migrants who lack old - age and medical insurance in the towns and cities they want to call home , media reports said on Monday . 

The study , based on survey data from 2010 , is the latest to underscore how important , and how challenging , the ramifications of <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s tide of urbanisation are . 

Our country still faces many challenges in achieving healthy urbanisation , ¡± said the report , according to a summary from the <ORG> Xinhua </ORG> news agency . 

At present , we still have not formed a sensible array of cities and towns , and overall urban capacity urgently needs to be strengthened , ¡± it said . 

The migrant population strongly desires to be absorbed into the areas where they live , but there is a stark conflict between supply and demand of urban public services . ¡± 

<LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s census last year found the country had 1.34 billion people , and 670 million were residents of towns and cities . 

Many new urbanites are young rural migrants with no plans to return to villages and farming after years in factories and on building sites , unlike their parents¡¯ generation . 

Although their wages have risen in recent years , this ¡° new generation ¡± of migrants also needs better housing , healthcare and schooling opportunities . 

The report found 52 percent of <MISC> Chinese </MISC> rural migrants had no social welfare insurance . 

In June , migrant workers rioted in far southern <LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s manufacturing belt , trashing government offices and police vehicles after a pregnant peddler was roughed up by guards , triggering anger about mistreatment . 

A string of strikes at <MISC> Japanese </MISC> - owned vehicle parts makers last year also showed the growing assertiveness of younger <MISC> Chinese </MISC> workers . 

<LOC> China </LOC> has about 153 million migrant workers living outside their home towns , and by 2009 , 58.4 percent of them were ¡° new generation ¡± migrants born in 1980 or after , according to an earlier <ORG> National Bureau of Statistics </ORG> survey . 

The latest report found that 76.3 percent of this ¡° new generation ¡± of migrants had no plans to return to the areas they came from , and most of those that did have plans to return wanted to find jobs in towns , not return to farming .

Salvage experts were racing to secure a container ship which ran aground on a reef off <LOC> New Zealand </LOC> as oil started to wash up on Monday along beaches of a popular holiday resort . 

The 47,230-tonne <MISC> Liberian </MISC> - flagged <PER> Rena </PER> has been stuck on the reef , about 12 nautical miles from <LOC> Tauranga </LOC> on the east coast of the <LOC> country ¡¯s North Island </LOC> , since running aground early on Wednesday . 

<LOC> Maritime New Zealand </LOC> said the weather was about to get worse . 

¡° Seas are moderate but they will become rough later , there will be poor visibility 

and we are expecting showers , ¡± it said in a statement . 

The ship is carrying 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil , which has been transferred to secure tanks at the rear of the vessel and is slowly being pumped into a barge . 

Containers are being lashed more tightly . 

¡° Salvage experts and naval architects on board are very closely monitoring the ship and have got sensors in place that will provide advance warning if the vessel ¡¯s structure is coming under too much stress , ¡± <ORG> Maritime NZ </ORG> said . 

The first oil from the ship has also been found on nearby beaches with clean up teams moving in to collect the fist - sized clumps of thick , toxic oil . 

The district is a popular holiday resort , with long , golden beaches renowned for surfing , and nearby waters with an international reputation for big - game fishing . 

As much as 30 tonnes of oil is estimated to have escaped from the 236-metre ship , which has been holed in two forward compartments and is listing at 10 degrees . 

All vents have been sealed to prevent oil escaping . 

Several seabirds have died and about a dozen have been recovered and treated for oil contamination . 

The ship ¡¯s owners , <PER> Daina </PER> Shipping , a unit of <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Costamare Inc. </ORG> , said minimising the pollution risk was the priority . 

¡° The current primary focus of the salvage operations is the safe transfer of the vessel ¡¯s fuel oil from her tanks into a suitable vessel , ¡± <PER> Costamare </PER> said . 

Refloating and salvage of the ship , of which more than half is aground on the reef , is the responsibility of the owners and salvage experts , but any plan needs official approval .

* Jets return to <ORG> Winnipeg </ORG> after 15 years 

* Team gets standing ovation despite loss 

<LOC> WINNIPEG </LOC> , <LOC> Manitoba </LOC> , Oct 9 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> welcomed back its beloved Jets on Sunday , as the <MISC> National Hockey League </MISC> ( NHL ) returned to the <MISC> western Canadian </MISC> city 15 years after its heartbreaking exit . 

The <ORG> Montreal Canadiens </ORG> beat the Jets 5 - 1 in <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> ¡¯s first game of the NHL regular season , but the result was hardly the point as the <LOC> Manitoba </LOC> provincial capital reclaimed what it once lost to poor economics . 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> ¡¯s True North Sports and Entertainment , led by local businessman <PER> Mark Chipman </PER> and <ORG> Thomson Reuters Corp </ORG> chairman <PER> David Thomson </PER> , bought the money - losing <ORG> Atlanta Thrashers </ORG> after last season and moved them north to become <LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s seventh team in the 30-team NHL . 

<PER> Derrick Edmundson </PER> , 55 , watched the last Jets game in 1996 and did n¡¯t expect to see the NHL return any time soon after the team moved to <LOC> Phoenix </LOC> , <LOC> Arizona </LOC> to become the <ORG> Coyotes </ORG> . 

¡° To have them back in our generation is unbelievable , ¡± he said . 

We ¡¯re in the center of the <MISC> hockey universe </MISC> today - how fun is that ? ¡± 

Although <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> , population 695,000 , was devastated to lose the Jets , the loss was a turning point , co - owner <PER> Chipman </PER> . 

The city built new sports facilities and its manufacturing , farming and mining economy grew steadily . 

The NHL and its players eventually agreed on a salary cap and the <MISC> Canadian </MISC> dollar has soared to near parity with the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> greenback , cutting costs for small <MISC> Canadian </MISC> markets . 

I tell people how it happened , ¡± <PER> Chipman </PER> said of the return . 

I ¡¯m not sure I can say why it happened . 

An enormous number of good things happened . 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> sold out its 13,000 season tickets in minutes last spring in a frenzy of anticipation . 

On Sunday , <LOC> jersey </LOC> - clad fans packed the <LOC> MTS Centre arena </LOC> and chanted ¡® Go Jets 

Go¡¯ hours before the opening faceoff , while nearby thousands of fans who could n¡¯t get tickets cheered the team on a giant TV screen . 

¡° I think everyone has taken note of the enthusiasm and the passion for our game , ¡± said NHL commissioner <PER> Gary Bettman </PER> , who was villified in <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> when the last team left . 

We have no reason to believe other than this team will be an absolute success . ¡± 

The <ORG> Canadiens </ORG> jumped to a 2 - 0 lead before <PER> Nik Antropov </PER> cut the lead in half with the first goal for the reborn Jets in the third period . 

<ORG> Montreal </ORG> put the game out of reach with three more goals . 

Despite the loss , <ORG> Winnipeg </ORG> fans saluted the NHL ¡¯s return with a standing ovation in the final minute .

¡° I think you just try to use the excitement in the game , ¡± said Jets captain <PER> Andrew Ladd </PER> , asked if the players had gotten too caught up in the fan hoopla .

The first version of the Jets began play in 1972 in the now - <ORG> defunct World Hockey Association </ORG> and moved into the NHL in 1979 . 

After 17 seasons , a weak <MISC> Canadian </MISC> dollar , aging arena and escalating player salaries led to its sale and relocation . 

¡° What happened was unfortunate , ¡± said <PER> Keith Tkachuk </PER> , who was a bruising winger on the Jets team that moved to <LOC> Phoenix </LOC> .

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> welcomed back its beloved Jets on Sunday , as the <MISC> National Hockey League </MISC> ( NHL ) returned to the <MISC> western Canadian </MISC> city 15 years after its heartbreaking exit . 

The <ORG> Montreal Canadiens </ORG> beat the Jets 5 - 1 in <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> ¡¯s first game of the NHL regular season , but the result was hardly the point as the <LOC> Manitoba </LOC> provincial capital reclaimed what it once lost to poor economics . 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> ¡¯s True North Sports and Entertainment , led by local businessman <PER> Mark Chipman </PER> and <ORG> Thomson Reuters Corp </ORG> chairman <PER> David Thomson </PER> , bought the money - losing <ORG> Atlanta Thrashers </ORG> after last season and moved them north to become <LOC> Canada </LOC> ¡¯s seventh team in the 30-team NHL . 

<PER> Derrick Edmundson </PER> , 55 , watched the last Jets game in 1996 and did n¡¯t expect to see the NHL return any time soon after the team moved to <LOC> Phoenix </LOC> , <LOC> Arizona </LOC> to become the <ORG> Coyotes </ORG> . 

¡° To have them back in our generation is unbelievable , ¡± he said . 

We ¡¯re in the center of the <MISC> hockey universe </MISC> today - how fun is that ? ¡± 

Although <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> , population 695,000 , was devastated to lose the Jets , the loss was a turning point , co - owner <PER> Chipman </PER> . 

The city built new sports facilities and its manufacturing , farming and mining economy grew steadily . 

The NHL and its players eventually agreed on a salary cap and the <MISC> Canadian </MISC> dollar has soared to near parity with the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> greenback , cutting costs for small <MISC> Canadian </MISC> markets . 

I tell people how it happened , ¡± <PER> Chipman </PER> said of the return . 

I ¡¯m not sure I can say why it happened . 

An enormous number of good things happened . 

<LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> sold out its 13,000 season tickets in minutes last spring in a frenzy of anticipation . 

On Sunday , <LOC> jersey </LOC> - clad fans packed the <ORG> MTS Center arena </ORG> and chanted ¡® Go Jets 

Go¡¯ hours before the opening faceoff , while nearby thousands of fans who could n¡¯t get tickets cheered the team on a giant TV screen . 

¡° I think everyone has taken note of the enthusiasm and the passion for our game , ¡± said NHL commissioner <PER> Gary Bettman </PER> , who was villified in <LOC> Winnipeg </LOC> when the last team left .

Salvage experts were racing to secure a container ship which ran aground on a reef off <LOC> New Zealand </LOC> as oil started to wash up on Monday along beaches of a popular holiday resort . 

The 47,230-tonne <MISC> Liberian </MISC> - flagged <PER> Rena </PER> has been stuck on the reef , about 12 nautical miles from <LOC> Tauranga </LOC> on the east coast of the <LOC> country ¡¯s North Island </LOC> , since running aground early on Wednesday . 

<LOC> Maritime New Zealand </LOC> said the weather was about to get worse . 

¡° Seas are moderate but they will become rough later , there will be poor visibility 

and we are expecting showers , ¡± it said in a statement . 

The ship is carrying 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil , which has been transferred to secure tanks at the rear of the vessel and is slowly being pumped into a barge . 

Containers are being lashed more tightly . 

¡° Salvage experts and naval architects on board are very closely monitoring the ship and have got sensors in place that will provide advance warning if the vessel ¡¯s structure is coming under too much stress , ¡± <ORG> Maritime NZ </ORG> said . 

The first oil from the ship has also been found on nearby beaches with clean up teams moving in to collect the fist - sized clumps of thick , toxic oil . 

The district is a popular holiday resort , with long , golden beaches renowned for surfing , and nearby waters with an international reputation for big - game fishing . 

As much as 30 tonnes of oil is estimated to have escaped from the 236-meter ship , which has been holed in two forward compartments and is listing at 10 degrees . 

All vents have been sealed to prevent oil escaping . 

Several seabirds have died and about a dozen have been recovered and treated for oil contamination . 

The ship ¡¯s owners , <PER> Daina </PER> Shipping , a unit of <LOC> Greece </LOC> ¡¯s <ORG> Costamare Inc. </ORG> , said minimising the pollution risk was the priority . 

¡° The current primary focus of the salvage operations is the safe transfer of the vessel ¡¯s fuel oil from her tanks into a suitable vessel , ¡± <PER> Costamare </PER> said . 

Refloating and salvage of the ship , of which more than half is aground on the reef , is the responsibility of the owners and salvage experts , but any plan needs official approval . 

The Port of <LOC> Tauranga </LOC> , 200 km ( 120 miles ) southeast of <LOC> New Zealand </LOC> ¡¯s biggest city , <LOC> Auckland </LOC> , is the country ¡¯s biggest export port and a hub for transshipping cargo .

Global miner <ORG> BHP Billiton </ORG> moved a step closer on Monday toward an estimated $ 20 billion expansion of its massive <MISC> Olympic </MISC> Dam copper and uranium mine , securing federal environmental approval for the project in the deserts of <LOC> south Australia </LOC> . 

<ORG> BHP Billiton </ORG> is expected to give the final go - ahead to the project by June 2012 . 

It has yet to reveal the cost of the expansion , but analysts rank it as possibly the single biggest on the drawing board of the world ¡¯s biggest miner . 

The federal government imposed more than 100 conditions on the expansion . 

¡° The strict conditions I ¡¯ve imposed will help ensure protection of the natural environment , including native species , groundwater and vegetation , for the long term , ¡± Environment Minister <PER> Tony Burke </PER> said in a statement . 

The expansion still needs approvals from the <MISC> South Australian </MISC> and Northern Territory governments , expected to follow soon . 

Monday ¡¯s clearance follows a six - year review of the expected impact of the expansion on everything from air quality in neighbouring towns to cuttlefish in the <LOC> Spencer Gulf </LOC> . 

The expansion calls for a <MISC> new open </MISC> - pit mine to increase production capacity to a maximum of 750,000 tonnes a year of copper , or nearly quadruple its current production . 

The expansion would lift the mine ¡¯s annual production of uranium to 19,000 tonnes , from around 4,000 tonnes now . 

The plan includes building a new airport , a new gas - fired power station , a desalination plant with a 320-kilometre pipeline and a 105-km rail line . 

<ORG> BHP </ORG> has not given any cost estimate for the expansion except to say that <MISC> Olympic </MISC> Dam would make up a ¡° modest proportion ¡± of the company ¡¯s plan to spend $ 80 billion on projects over the next five years .

Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - <LOC> Australia </LOC> ¡¯s competition watchdog said on Monday it would pay close attention to the market power of top supermarkets <ORG> Woolworths </ORG> and <ORG> Coles </ORG> , which hold a duopoly . 

The <ORG> Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ¡¯s new </ORG> chairman , <PER> Rod Sims </PER> , said many suppliers felt they had no ability to negotiate with the powerful supermarket chains . 

The two major supermarkets have significant market power , with many smaller suppliers feeling they lack a real ability to negotiate supply arrangements . 

The <ORG> ACCC </ORG> can and will watch closely to ensure any such dealings do not involve unconscionable conduct by the supermarkets , ¡± <PER> Sims </PER> told a business lunch . 

Many local and international food suppliers , including <ORG> Kraft </ORG> Foods and <PER> Goodman </PER> Fielder , have said they have little ability to negotiate as the two supermarket chains dominate the industry and have also increased their share of home - label goods . 

<PER> Sims </PER> said the supermarkets would need close scrutiny to ensure they did not misuse market power by selling both branded and private - label products . 

In 2008 , the consumer watchdog held an inquiry into the supermarket industry and concluded it was ¡° workably competitive ¡± . 

<PER> Sims </PER> said the <ORG> ACCC </ORG> would also watch dominant telecoms firm <ORG> Telstra </ORG> during the rollout phase of the new high - speed broadband network , when rivals will still depend on <ORG> Telstra </ORG> ¡¯s copper network . 

For only the second time in 348 career starts on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> , <PER> Briny Baird </PER> felt he was poised to win a tournament before falling agonisingly short Sunday at the <MISC> Frys.com Open </MISC> . 

Seeking his maiden victory on the <LOC> U.S. circuit </LOC> , journeyman <ORG> Baird </ORG> was beaten by fellow <MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Bryce Molder </PER> on the sixth hole of a sudden - death playoff after missing a seven - foot birdie putt for the title four holes earlier . 

¡° I ¡¯m happy , and I ¡¯m very disappointed , <ORG> ¡± Baird </ORG> told reporters after watching <PER> Molder </PER> sink a six - footer for birdie at the par - four 18th to claim his own breakthrough success on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> . 

¡° I know how long I ¡¯ve played , and I lost my concentration one time today and it was one of the putts that I had to win the golf tournament . 

I looked ahead , and that was a mistake , ¡± he said , referring to a missed birdie opportunity on the second extra hole . 

¡° I do n¡¯t know if I missed the putt because of that or what , but I did some really good things today . 

I was happy with the good things , I ¡¯m not happy with the outcome , but what are you going to do ? 

<ORG> Baird </ORG> , who had led by two shots going into the final round at CordeValle Golf Club , closed with a four - under - par 67 to finish level with <PER> Molder </PER> at 17-under 267 . 

Four times previously <ORG> Baird </ORG> had been a runner - up on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> but only once - at the 2001 <MISC> John Deere Classic </MISC> - did he feel capable of clinching the title . 

I did n¡¯t feel like I was out there to win the tournament , <ORG> ¡± Baird </ORG> , 39 , said . 

I was ready for the tournament to kind of fall back to me . 

Today I felt like I was out there to win the tournament . 

I hit some shots when I really needed to hit some shots , and for me that ¡¯s a big deal . 

There ¡¯s a hurdle that I overcame today . 

<ORG> Baird </ORG> appeared to have the title in his grasp in regulation play after he chipped in to eagle the drivable par - four 17th but <PER> Molder </PER> joined him at 17 under with a birdie at the last . 

¡° Going into the day , it was like a lot of Sundays I ¡¯ve gone into , <ORG> ¡± Baird </ORG> said . 

I was n¡¯t feeling great , but I figured if I could just stick to my game plan and stick with a routine ... 

And I did that really , really good . 

The <ORG> Detroit Tigers </ORG> have lost <PER> Magglio Ordonez </PER> for the remainder of the playoffs after the veteran outfielder re - injured his troublesome right ankle , the team said on Sunday . 

<PER> Ordonez </PER> was taken out of the <MISC> Tigers¡¯ series </MISC> - opening loss to the <ORG> Texas Rangers </ORG> in the fifth inning on Saturday , and it was later revealed that the 37-year - old had broken the same ankle that forced him to miss the second half of the 2010 season . 

We did n¡¯t have all the facts and details , but we ¡¯ve had some medical work done this morning , ¡± <ORG> Tigers </ORG> manager <PER> Jim Leyland </PER> told the <ORG> team ¡¯s website </ORG> ( <ORG> Detroit.tigers.mlb.com </ORG> ) . 

The <ORG> Tigers </ORG> , who trail 1 - 0 in their best - of - seven <MISC> American League Championship Series </MISC> against the <ORG> Rangers </ORG> , are already short on outfielders . 

<PER> Delmon Young </PER> was also kept off the ALCS roster because of an oblique strain suffered in the Tigers¡¯ Game Five victory over the <ORG> New York Yankees </ORG> in their <MISC> AL Division Series </MISC> . 

<PER> Ordonez </PER> has played with the <ORG> Tigers </ORG> since 2005 and was hitting .385 during the playoffs . 

Game Two of the series was postponed on Sunday because of rain in <LOC> Texas </LOC> and has been rescheduled for Monday .

( The following was released by the rating agency ) 

<LOC> SINGAPORE </LOC> , October 9 ( Fitch ) Fitch Ratings says the ongoing capitalisation efforts of major <MISC> Vietnamese </MISC> banks are positive given their thinly capitalised position by regional comparison . 

Given the challenging operating environment , capitalisation levels are a key credit factor and Fitch believes more equity may still be required . 

Although credit growth has moderated in 2011 and notwithstanding fresh capital injection , higher capitalisation buffer is crucial for potential losses as well as for future expansion plans , ¡± says <PER> Mikho Irawady </PER> in <ORG> Fitch ¡¯s Financial Institutions team </ORG> . 

¡° Banks in general continue to target rapid growth in a country where credit reached 120 % of GDP at end-2010 , high by emerging market standards . 

This exposes the banks to sharp deterioration in asset quality should the already difficult operating environment take a turn for the worse . ¡± 

In addition , Fitch believes that the system - wide gross non - performing loan ratio may be significantly higher than the reported 3 % at end - July 2011 , noting the differences in asset quality data between <MISC> Vietnamese </MISC> Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards and poor transparency . 

Fitch recognises the regulatory efforts to raise capital levels , although these have been subjected to delays in the past . 

The agency believes regulatory capital requirements may be raised further and could eventually lead to consolidation in the system over the medium to long term , especially for the smaller banks in <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> . 

Increased foreign banks¡¯ participation may be positive , by way of strengthening technical assistance , knowledge transfer and risk management , although any liberalisation moves are more likely to be a long - term prospect . 

In the near term , committed efforts by the government to bring more stability to the operating environment , such as reducing inflation , are crucial to the banks¡¯ financial profiles . 

Some of the announced deals in 2010 - 2011 include <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> Joint - <ORG> Stock Commercial Bank for Industry </ORG> and Trade with a 10 % stake by <ORG> International Finance Corporation </ORG> ( and with a further 15 % stake reportedly being considered by <ORG> Bank of Nova Scotia </ORG> ) ; and Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of <LOC> Vietnam </LOC> with a 15 % stake by <ORG> Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. </ORG> 

<ORG> Asia Commercial Bank </ORG> and <ORG> Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank </ORG> also reportedly have plans to boost their capital through share sales . 

<ORG> Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam </ORG> is preparing for IPO by Q411 . 

State - owned <ORG> Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development </ORG> has received capital injection from the government in the past and may receive additional capital to boost its capital ratio , which is presently below the regulatory minimum of 9 % . 

<MISC> Vietnamese </MISC> banks are currently among the lowest - rated banks in the region . 

Fitch - rated banks are <ORG> Asia Commercial Bank </ORG> ( <ORG> ¡® B¡¯/Stable </ORG> ) , <ORG> Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank </ORG> ( <ORG> ¡® B¡¯/Stable </ORG> ) , <ORG> Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development </ORG> ( <ORG> ¡® B¡¯/Stable </ORG> ) and Vietnam Joint - <ORG> Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade </ORG> ( ¡® B¡¯/Stable ) .

The two companies have basically finished discussions for a manufacturing tie - up , the newspaper said cited an unnamed source . 

<ORG> Chery </ORG> spokesman said he had no information about it , so did a representative from <ORG> Jaguar and Land Rover </ORG> . 

<ORG> Chery </ORG> and <ORG> Fuji </ORG> Heavy Industries had planned to make <ORG> Subaru </ORG> vehicles in <LOC> China </LOC> .

At least 11 <MISC> Chinese </MISC> sailors were killed when their ships were attacked on the Mekong River between <LOC> Thailand </LOC> and <LOC> Myanmar </LOC> , the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> Foreign Ministry said , voicing concern about what media reports said was an assault by drug traffickers . 

The sailors were on two cargo ships attacked on October 5 in the <ORG> ¡° Golden Triangle ¡± of the Mekong </ORG> , a region of Southeast <LOC> Asia </LOC> notorious for its illicit drug trade , the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> Foreign Ministry said on its website ( <ORG> www.mfa.gov.cn </ORG> ) late Sunday . 

As well as the 11 sailors killed , two were missing , said the ministry . 

But officials in <LOC> Yunnan </LOC> , the <MISC> Chinese </MISC> province bordering <LOC> Thailand </LOC> and <LOC> Myanmar </LOC> , said 12 were killed and one was missing , the <ORG> China News Service </ORG> said . 

The bodies were recovered near <LOC> Chiang Saen </LOC> , a river port in north <LOC> Thailand </LOC> , with hands bound and eyes covered with adhesive tape , the <ORG> China Daily </ORG> reported . 

<LOC> China </LOC> ¡¯s growing presence in <LOC> Asia </LOC> , <LOC> Africa </LOC> and other parts of the world has prompted attacks , kidnappings and hijackings , and the issue has become a sensitive one for <MISC> Chinese </MISC> officials , who do not want to appear weak in protecting nationals . 

<LOC> Beijing </LOC> has ¡° asked the countries concerned to take effective measures to strengthen protection of <MISC> Chinese </MISC> vessels and crew on the <LOC> Mekong River </LOC> , ¡± the <ORG> Foreign Ministry </ORG> said . 

Crew on another boat that saw the attack said eight or so armed men stormed the two ships , said the <LOC> China </LOC> News Service . 

The attackers appeared to be smugglers seeking to use the seized ships to traffic drugs , said the report , citing <MISC> Thai </MISC> media accounts . 

The owner of one of the boats attacked said robberies were common on the river , said the <LOC> China </LOC> Daily . 

<MISC> Thai </MISC> river police recovered the two boats after a gunfight with the men onboard and found five sacks holding a total of about 900,000 pills of methamphetamine , or ¡° speed , ¡± an illegal drug , said the <ORG> China Daily </ORG> , citing <MISC> Thai </MISC> news reports . 

The Mekong snakes from <LOC> China </LOC> into Southeast <LOC> Asia </LOC> , where it forms part of <LOC> Thailand </LOC> ¡¯s border with <LOC> Myanmar </LOC> and <LOC> Laos </LOC> , and in 2001 the four countries signed an agreement to regularize shipping on the river .

Global miner <ORG> BHP Billiton </ORG> 

secured environmental approval from the <MISC> South Australian </MISC> government on Monday for an estimated $ 20 billion expansion of its massive <MISC> Olympic </MISC> Dam copper and uranium mine . 

<ORG> BHP Billiton </ORG> is expected to give the final go - ahead for the project by June 2012 . 

It has yet to reveal the cost of the expansion but analysts rank it as possibly the single biggest on the drawing board of the world ¡¯s biggest miner . 

The state approval comes only hours after the federal government also gave the project the environmental go - ahead . 

The <LOC> South Australia </LOC> state government , in announcing the project ¡¯s key approval , made it a condition that the company must start project construction within five years . 

It also said it aimed to finalise an agreement on royalties and infrastructure commitments for the expansion by Oct. 20 . 

¡° I anticipate an agreement can be reached soon , ¡± <PER> Tom Koutsantonis </PER> , the <ORG> state ¡¯s minister for mineral resources development </ORG> , said in a statement . 

Winless on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> this season , three - times major champion <PER> Ernie Els </PER> was once again left to rue erratic putting after he tied for fourth at the <MISC> Frys.com Open </MISC> Sunday . 

The smooth - swinging <MISC> South African </MISC> , who used a belly putter at CordeValle Golf Club this week after mainly struggling on the greens in recent years , briefly held a share of the lead early in Sunday ¡¯s final round before slipping back . 

¡° I ¡¯m a little disappointed because I feel I played good enough to maybe be in the playoff , ¡± <PER> Els </PER> told reporters after totaling 29 putts and posting a 14-under total of 270 , three shy of going into extra holes for the title . 

¡± he said of his six - foot attempt for birdie which horseshoed out of the <MISC> cup </MISC> . 

I lipped out and then I missed another short one on 10 . 

¡° I made a lot of good putts throughout the week , but I just feel if I want to get to that next level 

I want to get to , I got ta start making those putts when I need them . 

I did that when I won , so I know what to do . ¡± 

An 18-times winner on the <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> , <PER> Els </PER> has not triumphed on the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> circuit since the 2010 <PER> Arnold Palmer Invitational </PER> and he had struggled this season with a best finish of joint 15th in his previous 20 starts . 

¡° I have changed a lot of things and I feel that the work I ¡¯ve put in is starting to come through , ¡± said <PER> Els </PER> , who has reunited with his long - time caddie <PER> Ricci Roberts </PER> and also changed management companies . 

¡° I ¡¯m starting to feel comfortable on the things I ¡¯ve been working on . 

This week , I think we ¡¯ve made some progress , even though we ¡¯ve came up short . 

The wheels are starting to turn now . 

<PER> Els </PER> , who decided to compete in this week ¡¯s second - tier Fall Series event in a bid to regain to form and also to help out one of his corporate sponsors , only gave up on his title bid after the penultimate hole . 

Even on 17 , I thought I still had a chance , but then Briny ( <ORG> Baird </ORG> ) chipped it in for eagle , and that was that , ¡± the 41-year - <MISC> old South African </MISC> , popularly known as the ¡® Big Easy¡¯ , said after closing with a three - under 68 . 

¡° I thought maybe if I could sneak an eagle there and then birdie the 18th , I could get into a playoff . 

You kind of never give up until the end , but when he made eagle , it was done . ¡± 

<ORG> Baird </ORG> ended up losing the playoff to fellow <MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Bryce Molder </PER> on the sixth extra hole . 

<PER> Bryce Molder </PER> won his first <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> title by outlasting fellow <MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Briny Baird </PER> in a nerve - jangling playoff for the <MISC> Frys.com Open </MISC> at <LOC> CordeValle Golf </LOC> Club on Sunday . 

<PER> Molder </PER> sealed victory with a six - foot birdie putt at the par - four 18th , the sixth extra hole , where <ORG> Baird </ORG> could only par after his drive ended up in thick rough to the right of the fairway . 

As his ball disappeared into the <MISC> cup </MISC> , <PER> Molder </PER> dropped his putter to the ground in a mixture of delight and relief before embracing his caddie and shaking hands with <ORG> Baird </ORG> . 

¡° It ¡¯s a little surreal right now , ¡± the 32-year - old <MISC> American </MISC> said greenside in fading light after finally breaking into the winner ¡¯s circle on his 132nd <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> start . 

A lot of golf today , but it was a lot of fun . 

¡° You practice and you work and everything , and you just hope there is some validation behind it . 

I got some breaks at the right time today and I am excited . ¡± 

Journeyman <ORG> Baird </ORG> , who had been seeking his maiden <MISC> PGA Tour </MISC> victory on his 348th start after career earnings of nearly $ 12 million , settled for a fifth runner - up finish on the circuit . 

¡° I played really well , ¡± the 39-year - old <MISC> American </MISC> said . 

Obviously I am very disappointed right now . 

but I honestly thought I ¡¯d be standing right where <PER> Bryce </PER> is . 

¡° I had my chances , but I did some good stuff this week 

The pair had finished the 72 regulation holes at 17-under - par 267 , overnight leader <ORG> Baird </ORG> closing with a four - under 67 and <PER> Molder </PER> firing a seven - birdie 64 . 

While the long - time bridesmaids battled for the title , former world number one Tiger Woods was packed up and gone after posting 68 to finish 30th in his first event in almost two months . 

<MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Bud Cauley </PER> , who turned professional before the <MISC> U.S. Open </MISC> in June , finished alone in third at 15 under par after signing off with a 66 . 

Three - times major winner <PER> Ernie Els </PER> , who had been tied for second place overnight , briefly held a share of the lead on the way to a 68 and a share of fourth place with <MISC> American </MISC> <PER> Shane Bertsch </PER> ( 64 ) at 14 under . 

<ORG> Baird </ORG> , two ahead of the chasing pack going into another sunny day at CordeValle , bogeyed the par - four sixth after missing the green to the left with his approach and was caught at the top by <PER> Cauley </PER> and <PER> Els </PER> . 

<PER> Cauley </PER> rolled in a 20-footer to birdie the par - four eighth and <MISC> South African </MISC> Els , moments later , sank a five - foot birdie putt at the par - three seventh to make it a three - way tie . 

<ORG> Baird </ORG> regained a one - shot lead when he coaxed in a 30-footer to birdie the eighth before reaching the turn a stroke in front of his rivals . 

The leaderboard fluctuated wildly as the final threesome negotiated the back nine . 

Little - known <PER> Bertsch </PER> vaulted to the top when he rolled in a 24-foot eagle putt at the par - five 15th before being caught by <PER> Molder </PER> , who birdied 10 and 12 . 

<PER> Bertsch </PER> stumbled with a bogey at the par - three 16th after overshooting the green off the tee and <PER> Molder </PER> briefly moved two ahead when he sank a seven - footer to birdie the 13th . 

<ORG> Baird </ORG> closed to within a stroke of the lead with a two - putt birdie at the par - five 15th before he spectacularly regained control with a chip - in for eagle at the short par - four 17th . 

<PER> Molder </PER> , who had horseshoed out with a birdie attempt from 10 feet on 17 , signed off in style with an 11-foot birdie putt at the last to take the tournament into a playoff .

<ORG> TOKYO </ORG> ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - Support for <MISC> Japanese </MISC> Prime Minister <PER> Yoshihiko Noda </PER> ¡¯s government dropped by 10 points to 55 percent one month after he took office , with more than half opposing planned tax increases for post - quake restructuring efforts , a poll showed on Monday . 

<PER> Noda </PER> , who became the country ¡¯s sixth prime minister in five years , had gained strong support shortly after taking office in early September ¡ª a sharp turnaround from his unpopular predecessor , <PER> Naoto Kan </PER> , who saw his support fall below 20 percent . 

But just after a week in office , <PER> Noda </PER> was forced to fire his trade minister due to gaffes . 

The disapproval rating for his government rose to 29 percent , the survey by <ORG> Yomiuri </ORG> newspaper showed , up 10 points from the previous month ¡¯s poll . 

<PER> Noda </PER> , a fiscal hawk who favors raising taxes to increase government revenue , has promised swift fiscal reforms to cope with the massive public debt ¡ª now twice the size of <LOC> Japan </LOC> ¡¯s $ 5 trillion economy ¡ª but with an eye on growth . 

The survey of 1,036 respondents showed that 55 percent were against the government ¡¯s plan to raise income and corporate taxes to support the restructuring of northeastern <LOC> Japan </LOC> hit hard by the devastating March 11 earthquake and tsunami . 

It showed 38 backed the tax hike plans . 

The March disaster triggered the world ¡¯s worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986 , heating up debate in <LOC> Japan </LOC> over its future energy policy . 

The survey showed 48 percent supported <PER> Noda </PER> ¡¯s plan to restart nuclear power plants that have completed routine inspections , while 38 percent opposed the idea . 

<LOC> Japan </LOC> ¡¯s is aiming to launch this month its public - private panel chaired by <PER> Noda </PER> for devising long - term policies spanning economic , trade and energy that it hopes will wield considerable clout in running the country . 

The panel is expected to discuss whether to join negotiations on a <LOC> U.S </LOC> .- led free trade pact , called the <MISC> Transpacific Partnership </MISC> ( TPP ) . 

The <ORG> Yomiuri </ORG> poll showed 51 percent said <LOC> Japan </LOC> should join the <MISC> TPP </MISC> talks , while 23 percent were against the idea . 

Many <MISC> Japanese </MISC> businesses are keen to join the <MISC> TPP </MISC> , which could add growth , though farming lobbies have resisted the move as it would lower barriers to goods and services from overseas . 

<PER> Noda </PER> said on Monday the government would make a decision on whether to join the <MISC> TPP </MISC> talks in the near term after launching formal discussions on the issue on Tuesday , Kyodo news agency reported .

<LOC> SINGAPORE </LOC> / <LOC> SYDNEY </LOC> , Oct 10 ( <ORG> Reuters </ORG> ) - 

The <MISC> euro </MISC> edged higher on Monday after leaders of <LOC> Germany </LOC> and <LOC> France </LOC> promised a new comprehensive plan to recapitalise <MISC> euro </MISC> zone banks by the end of the month , though markets remain wary as they have been disappointed many times before . 

The meeting between <MISC> German </MISC> Chancellor <PER> Angela Merkel </PER> and <MISC> French </MISC> President <PER> Nicolas Sarkozy </PER> offered no details , but drew a pledge to do what is necessary to shore up banks , settle the <MISC> Greek </MISC> crisis and help growth in <LOC> Europe </LOC> , giving a gentle boost to risk sentiment . . 

Market players , however , remained cautious given the lack of details and since <ORG> EU </ORG> leaders have promised several times before to resolve the debt crisis , to no avail . 

The positive response could simply reflect the fact that positioning is now more balanced following earlier risk reduction , ¡± <PER> Todd Elmer </PER> , currency strategist at <ORG> Citi </ORG> in <LOC> Singapore </LOC> , said in a research note . 

It looks unlikely that EUR gains can be sustained absent further positive developments , ¡± he added . 

The <MISC> euro </MISC> climbed 0.5 percent to $ 1.3451 , pulling away from a nine - month low of $ 1.3145 hit last week on trading platform EBS . 

The single currency ¡¯s rise gained added steam after it breached hourly resistance at $ 1.3423 . 

Concrete steps to recapitalise <MISC> euro </MISC> zone banks could offer some relief to the <MISC> euro </MISC> , which has been dogged by mounting worries about the impact of the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis on the <MISC> European </MISC> banking sector . 

<LOC> France </LOC> , <LOC> Belgium </LOC> and <LOC> Luxembourg </LOC> agreed a rescue plan for <ORG> Dexia </ORG> , while other <MISC> French </MISC> banks have come under intense pressure because of their exposure to <LOC> Greece </LOC> and other weak <MISC> European </MISC> countries . 

<ORG> BNP Paribas </ORG> and <ORG> Societe Generale </ORG> denied they would seek to raise a combined 11 billion euros as part of a broader <MISC> European </MISC> recapitalisation plan . 

The single currency faces short - term resistance at around $ 1.3483 , the 76.4 percent retracement of the <MISC> euro </MISC> ¡¯s drop from Friday ¡¯s peak of $ 1.3525 down to a low of $ 1.3346 hit during early <MISC> Asian </MISC> trade on Monday . 

¡° On the <LOC> open Sydney </LOC> ran the sell stops down through Friday ¡¯s lows in EUR / USD ... 

So now that those orders are done , path of least resistance is up 

The pledge from <PER> Merkel </PER> and <PER> Sarkozy </PER> to come up with fresh measures to solve the <MISC> euro </MISC> zone ¡¯s debt crisis lent support to equities and helped nudge the <MISC> Australian </MISC> dollar higher . 

The Aussie dollar rose 0.5 percent to $ 0.9813 , pulling further away from a one - year low of $ 0.9388 hit last week . 

One risk for the <MISC> euro </MISC> and risky assets in general is the fact that the next aid tranche for <LOC> Greece </LOC> is far from being a done deal with the IMF indicating the nation is at a crossroads and will need to implement ¡° much stricter structural reforms ¡± than seen so far . 

<LOC> Athens </LOC> could run out of cash as soon as mid - November without the new 8 billion <MISC> euro </MISC> aid installment , increasing the risk of a default that would drag the region deeper into a debt crisis already shaking financial markets worldwide . 

Trading is expected to be thin throughout Monday with <LOC> Japan </LOC> off while the <LOC> U.S. </LOC> celebrates <MISC> Columbus Day </MISC> .
