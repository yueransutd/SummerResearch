much O
less O

It O
's O
certainly O
and O
surely O
possible O

Would O

How O
defined O
was O
the O
character O
of O

when O

Was O
it O
written O
on O
the O
page O
that O
you O
would O

deliberate O

or O
did O
you O
make O
all O

choices O

him O
? O
I O
hate O
to O
take O
all O

do O

How E-ORG

What O
happened O
was O
that O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
do O

spot O
. O
Within O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
of O
me O
finishing O

come O
back O

do O
the O

' O
Then O
they O
came O

' O
Would S-ORG
you O
do O
more O
? O
' O
I O
said O
yeah O
, O
I O
would O
, O
but O
not O
as O
a O
guest O
star O
. O
They O
asked O
me O
to O
do O
seven O
more O
guest O
spots O
, O
and O
I O
said O
, O
' O
No O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
interested O
in O
that O
. O
I O
'm O
interested O
in O
really O
finding O
out O
who O
this O
character O
is O
. O
' O
I O
prefaced O
all O
of O
that O
by O
saying O
that O
I O
loved O
the O
show O
. O
I O
adore O
and O
think O
that O
Vince B-PER
Gilligan E-PER
is O
brilliant O
. O
But O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
just O
come O
in O
and O
out O
… O
I O
want O
to O
come O
in O
and O
have O
a O
full O
canvas O
to O
work O
with O
, O
and O
I O
expressed O
that O
. O
I O
wound O
up O
doing O
11 O
, O
which O
was O
a O
clear O
indication O
… O
of O
their O
trust O
and O
devotion O
to O
doing O
what O
I O
previously O
had O
asked O
for O
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
able O
to O
create O
a O
complete O
character O
and O
to O
be O
part O
of O
a O
family O
. O
But O
again O
, O
Gus S-PER
was O
just O
a O
nice O
guy O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
chicken O
joint O
, O
who O
probably O
had O
some O
secrets O
, O
and O
they O
were O
hoping O
to O
uncover O
some O
of O
that O
. O
I O
am O
in O
gratitude O
that O
they O
found O
, O
through O
my O
performance O
, O
that O
they O
would O
like O
to O
uncover O
a O
whole O
lot O
more O
. O
Which O
they O
definitely O
did O
, O
especially O
, O
as O
we O
discussed O
, O
in O
the O
" O
Hermanos O
" O
episode O
. O
It O
was O
so O
satisfying O
for O
viewers O
to O
get O
a O
glimpse O
at O
what O
motivates O
Gus S-PER
… O
did O
you O
feel O
that O
way O
, O
too O
, O
when O
you O
read O

? O
I O
've O
done O
other O

, O
and O
they O
go O
along O
, O
and O
you O
have O
a O
dual O
thing O
going O
on O
, O
where O
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
be O
on O
something O
that O
's O
quality O
, O
and O
to O
make O
some O
money O
and O
feed O

Then O
, O
once O
( O

gets O
your O
office O
or O

, O
you O
know O

out O

With O
this O
( O
episode O
) O
, O
the O
triumph O
was O
that O
they O
asked O
me O
for O
some O
family O
pictures O
. O
I O
brought O
in O
pictures O
of O
my O
four O
daughters O
and O
put O
them O
all O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
( O
Viewers S-ORG
) O
never O
really O
saw O
them O
, O
but O
just O
in O
case O
one O
day O
they O
did O
and O
wanted O
to O
reflect O
back O
to O
that O
scene O
, O
they O
could O
see O
my O
family O
, O
which O
meant O
( O
Gus S-PER
) O
could O
have O
a O
wife O
. O
other O
… O
I O
could O
be O
living O
like O
Gus S-ORG
does O
in O
plain O
sight O
, O
but O
have O
the O
trimmings O
of O
the O
whole O
family O
. O
But O
, O
yes O
, O
for O
people O
to O
see O
the O
background O
of O
a O
character O
that O
you O
create O
and O
understand O
… O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
our O
villains O
that O
we O
experience O
, O
in O
many O
ways O
they O
're O
one O
note O
. O
I O
certainly O
did O

What O
truly O
motivates B-PER
Gus E-PER

I O
think O
that O
what O

much O
of O
what O
we O

been O
revenge O
, O
building O

since O
that O
really O
horrible O
moment O
that O
we O
finally O
see O
in O
( O
" O

, O
we O
understand O
him O
a O
different O
way O
. O
It O
's O
not O
only O
revenge O
, O
but O
the O
revenge O
has O
played O
into O
taking O
over O
, O
into O
making O
this O

his O

. O
I O
think O
if O
we O
were O
to O
go O
back O
even O
further O
than O
that O
, O
we O
'd O
see O
his O
connection O
to O
the O
Pinochet S-LOC
government O
and O
where O
all O
the O
previous O
incarnations O
of O

from O

what O
his O
dream O
for O
his O
empire O
is O
. O
We O
have O
n't O
seen O
that O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
motivation O
is O
a O

It O
's O
to O

“ O

I O

The O

want O
to O
prevent O
