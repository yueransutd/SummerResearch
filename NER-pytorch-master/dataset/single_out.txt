The
Boston
Bruins
put
their
Stanley
Cup
defense
back
on
track
with
a
convincing
4
-
1
win
at
home
over
the
Tampa
Bay
Lightning
Saturday
in
a
re
-
match
of
their
2011
Eastern
conference
final
.

The
Bruins
,
who
raised
their
champions
banner
before
crashing
to
a
2
-
1
loss
to
the
Philadelphia
Flyers
in
their
season
-
opening
game
Thursday
,
had
the
measure
of
Tampa
Bay
again
,
with
Rich
Peverly
leading
the
offence
with
two
goals
.

Following
a
goal
-
less
first
period
,
Peverley
sparked
a
scoring
flurry
of
three
goals
in
three
minutes
,
tapping
in
a
loose
puck
that
had
caromed
off
the
goal
post
from
a
shot
by
Brad
Marchand
.

“
I
think
as
long
as
we
’re
getting
chances
we
’re
going
to
be
happy
,
”
Peverley
said
.

And
if
we
continue
to
get
chances
we
’re
going
to
win
like
tonight
.

We
all
did
a
good
job
of
shooting
the
puck
and
getting
second
chances
and
that
’s
how
we
scored
the
goals
.
”

Tampa
Bay
’s
Martin
St.
Louis
scored
his
300th
NHL
goal
on
a
breakaway
to
tie
the
score
before
Daniel
Paille
restored
the
Bruins’
lead
,
re
-
directing
a
shot
from
the
blueline
by
Adam
McQuaid
.

David
Krejci
and
Peverley
added
a
goal
each
in
the
third
period
as
Boston
finished
with
42
scoring
shots
to
Tampa
Bay
’s
26
,
with
Marchand
and
Tyler
Seguin
chipping
in
with
two
assists
.

“
We
were
in
this
game
going
into
the
third
,
but
if
it
was
n’t
for
our
goaltender
,
it
could
’ve
been
a
three
-
goal
game
at
that
point
,
”
said
St.
Louis
of
his
goalie
Mathieu
Garon
.

“
They
just
kind
of
circled
our
players
.

We
got
outplayed
,
outpoised
,
outmuscled
and
outbattled
.

There
was
n’t
much
positive
to
take
out
of
this
game
,
besides
the
fact
that
our
goalie
gave
us
a
chance
going
into
the
third
period
.

UAW
vows
to
get
deal

Oshkosh
Corp
turned
down
a
new
five
-
year
contract
offer
from
the
company
for
a
second
time
in
little
more
than
a
week
on
Saturday
even
after
union
leaders
narrowed
differences
between
the
two
sides
in
recent
days
.

More
than
60
percent
of
hourly
employees
working
in
northeast
Wisconsin
plants
represented
by
the
United
Auto
Workers
union
voted
to
reject
the
contract
,
UAW
Local
578
President
Nick
Nitschke
said
in
an
email
to
Reuters
.

The
company
’s
desire
to
work
with
the
UAW
on
future
hiring
of
temporary
workers
remains
a
key
sticking
point
,
he
said
.

UAW
-
represented
workers
at
Oshkosh
,
totaling
3,000
more
than
employees
,
rejected
Oshkosh
’s
first
contract
offer
on
Sept.
30
even
though
that
meant
losing
a
$
2,000
signing
bonus
.

Company
and
union
officials
spent
the
past
week
negotiating
a
new
deal
that
included
reworded
language
on
seniority
and
temporary
workers
,
and
a
revised
financial
package
.

Oshkosh
is
a
leading
manufacturer
of
a
broad
range
of
military
,
fire
and
emergency
and
commercial
vehicles
.

The
labor
talks
are
being
closely
watched
by
investors
and
analysts
who
have
been
concerned
about
the
company
’s
exposure
to
a
defense
sector
that
is
under
pressure
.

Tension
over
temporary
workers
is
n’t
the
only
problem
still
left
to
resolve
.

The
company
’s
move
to
increase
its
pay
-
raise
offer
from
8
percent
in
the
original
contract
offer
to
8.5
percent
through
2016

“
did
n’t
fly
with
higher
insurance
costs
,
”
Nitschke
said
.

Oshkosh
is
proposing
to
raise
health
care
premiums
and
insurance
co
-
pays

“
It
’s
time
to
get
it
done
,
”
said
Nitschke
,
who
expects
to
start
bargaining
again
soon
.

We
are
not
going
to
let
it
go
on
much
longer
...

Workers
are
expected
to
continue
working
as
bargainers
continue
to

It

unclear
when

with

SACRAMENTO
(
Reuters
)
-
California
Governor
Jerry
Brown
on
Saturday
vetoed
legislation
that
would
have
allowed
California
universities
to
consider
race
and
gender
in
student
admissions
,
even
though
Brown
said
he
agreed
with
its
goal
.

The
measure
was
the
latest
attempt
to
scale
back
,
or
repeal
,
so
-
called
Proposition
209
approved
by
voters
in
1996
.

It
bars
public
agencies
from
considering
race
or
ethnicity
in
everything
from
awarding
contracts
to
accepting
undergraduates
.

“
I
wholeheartedly
agree
with
the
goal
of
this
legislation
,
”
Brown
wrote
in
his
veto
message
.

But
the
Democratic
governor
said
the
courts
should
determine
what
should
happen
to
Proposition
209
.

For
more
than
15
years
,
Proposition
209
has
prompted
fierce
debate
.

Opponents
said
it
narrowed
opportunities
for
women
and
minorities
to
succeed
in
California
.

Supporters
countered
that
it
simply
created
a
system
where
individual
ability
was
rewarded
.

The
California
Supreme
Court
last
August
ruled
that
it
was
constitutional
.

Republican
students
at
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
recently
took
a
satirical
swipe
at
the
proposed
law
vetoed
by
Brown
by
holding
an
affirmative
action
bake
sale
.

They
charged
whites
more
for
baked
goods
than
other
ethnicities
.

Hundreds
of
student
protesters
rallied
in
opposition
to
the
event
.

The
two
main
school
systems
that
would
have
been
affected
by
the
law
were
the
University
of
California
and
California
State
University
.

According
to
University
of
California
statistics
for
the
fall
of
2009
,
32
percent
of
undergraduates
were
white
,
3.5
African
American
,
16
percent
Latino
or
Chicano
and
30
percent
Asian
.

California
State
University
statistics
for
2009
showed
38
percent
of
its
undergraduates
were
white
,
six
percent
African
American
,
13
percent
Asian
and
25
percent
Latino
or
Chicano
.

The
figures
may
not
add
to
100
percent
because
of
students
who
declined
to
give
an
ethnicity
or
those
not
counted
such
as
international
students
.

Women
outnumbered
men
in
both
systems
with
53
percent
of
undergraduates
at
the
University
of
California
and
58
percent
of
the
student
body
at
California
State
University
.

The
Texas
Rangers
beat
the
Detroit
Tigers
3
-
2
in
a
rain
-
interrupted
opening
game
of
the
American
League
Championship
Series
on
Saturday
that
featured
a
show
-
stopping
performance
by
the
home
bullpen
.

Rangers
relievers
completely
shut
down
the
Tigers
,
preserving
a
one
-
run
lead
with
4
-
1/3
innings
of
one
-
hit
pitching
including
eight
strikeouts
.

Texas
closer
Neftali
Feliz
finished
it
off
in
style
,
striking
out
the
side
,
getting
his
third
strikes
on
pitches
that
hit
99
,
101
and
99
mph
on
the
radar
gun
.

The
back
of
our
bullpen
is
awesome
,

”
Rangers
catcher
Mike
Napoli
said
.

When
these
guys
come
in
,
we
expect
them
to
throw
zeros
.

The
Rangers
led
3
-
0
,
including
a
Nelson
Cruz
home
run
against
Detroit
ace
Justin
Verlander
,
going
into
the
fifth
inning
when
two
rain
delays
stalled
play
for
almost
two
hours
.

Detroit
scored
a
pair
of
runs
in
the
rain
-
marred
inning
off
Rangers
starter
C.J.
Wilson
,
but
a
procession
of
five
Texas
relievers
made
the
narrowest
of
advantages
stand
up
.

Verlander
,
who
led
the
American
League
in
wins
(
24
)
,
earned
run
average
(
2.40
)
and
strikeouts
(
250
)
took
the
loss
.

“
I
thought
tonight
his
control
was
not
good
,
”
Detroit
manager
Jim
Leyland
said
about
Verlander
.

He
could
n’t
get
his
curveball
over
for
strikes
when
he
needed
to
.
”

Wilson
had
looked
in
control
through
four
innings
but
after
the
first
rain
delay
in
the
fifth
he
struggled
.

One
run
scored
on
an
Austin
Jackson
double
and
another
came
across
on
a
Wilson
wild
pitch
after
the
left
-
hander
had
walked
two
batters
to
load
the
bases
.

After
the
second
rain
delay
,
left
-
hander
reliever
Mike
Gonzalez
came
on
and
retired
left
-
handed
hitting
Alex
Avila
with
the
bases
loaded
to
end
the
Detroit
threat
.

Alexi
Ogando
entered
in
the
sixth
and
threw
two
innings
of
no
-
hit
ball
and
was
credited
with
the
win
.

Darren
Oliver
and
Mike
Adams
served
as
a
bridge
to
Feliz
,
who
overpowered
the
Tigers
in
the
ninth
.

“
It
means
we
’re
one
game
closer
to
getting
to
the
World
Series
,
”
Texas
second
baseman
Ian
Kinsler
said
.

The
Rangers
took
the
lead
against
Verlander
with
two
runs
in
the
second
inning
on
a
run
-
scoring
triple
David
Murphy
and
an
RBI
-
single
from
Kinsler
.

Cruz
,
who
was
in

playoffs
slump
,
led
off
the
fourth
with
a

run

BEIJING
(
Reuters
)
-
China
’s
Communist
Party
elite
on
Sunday
marked
a
century
since
the
revolution
that
ended
millennia
of
rule
by
emperors
,
a
date
that
has
stoked
warnings
by
critics
that
the
party
must
tackle
deeper
reforms
or
also
risk
losing
power
.

China
’s
calendar
is
speckled
with
anniversaries
heavy
with
political
symbolism
,
and
even
the
distant
events
that
triggered
the
fall
of
the
Qing
dynasty
and
birth
of
a
republic
in
1911
-
12
have
become
a
focus
for
controversy
about
the
country
’s
future
.

President
Hu
Jintao
said
China
’s
history
since
the
toppling
of
the
Qing
dynasty
showed
that
one
-
party
rule
remained
vital
to
the
nation
’s
hopes
for
economic
prosperity
and
political
unity
,
including
reunification
with
self
-
ruled
Taiwan
.

To
achieve
the
great
revival
of
the
Chinese
nation
,
we
must
certainly
firmly
uphold
the
leadership
of
the
Chinese
Communist
Party
,
”
Hu
told
hundreds
of
officials
gathered
in
the
cavernous
Great
Hall
of
the
People
in
central
Beijing
in
a
nationally
televised
keynote
speech
celebrating
the
“
Xinhai
Revolution
.
”

But
the
party
’s
version
of
the
fall
of
the
dynasty
has
been
challenged
by
critics
who
say
the
chaotic
chain
of
coups
and
insurrections
that
toppled
the
corrupt
empire
and
subsequent
violent
faction
conflicts
and
invasion
by
Japan
are
a
reminder
of
the
need
for
democratic
reform
in
the
present
.

China
again
faces
a
dangerous
confluence
of
official
corruption
,
volatile
public
discontent
and
stalled
reform
,
Zhou
Ruijin
,
the
former
deputy
editor
-
in
-
chief
of
the
People
’s
Daily
newspaper
said
in
a
recent
essay
about
the
1911
revolution
.

“
Grievances
,
distrust
and
rancor
that
have
accumulated
over
many
years
have
reached
a
period
when
they
break
out
,
”
Zhou
wrote
in
a
Beijing
magazine
.

In
past
months
,
authorities
have
shown
how
sensitive
they
are
about
liberal
intellectuals
using
the
events
of
1911
as
a
mirror
to
criticize
or
cajole
the
government
.

Some
seminars
and
debates
about
the
anniversary
have
been
canceled
.

For
us
,
China
’s
Xinhai
Revolution
is
still
not
dead
history
,
it
still
has
a
strong
resonance
with
present
-
day
realities
,
”
said
Lei
Yi
,
an
historian
at
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Social
Sciences
in
Beijing
.

A
key
lesson
of
the
revolution
is
that
the
country
’s
fate
depends
on
whether
the
rulers
make
the
right
choices
about
advancing
reforms
.

Above
all
,
there
’s
still
the
issue
that
a
modern
China
needs
a
modern
form
of
government
—
constitutional
government
.

The
1911
revolution
has
also
been
celebrated
in
television
dramas
and
a
movie
whose
stars
include
Jackie
Chan
,
a
martial
arts
actor
better
know
for
high
kicks
than
high
politics
.

President
Hu
is
due
to
leave
office
from
late
next
year
,
when
a
Communist
Party
congress
will
install
a
new
leadership
.

The
1911
Revolution
gave
birth
to
the
Republic
of
China
in
early
1912
under
President
Sun
Yat
-
sen
.

Taiwan
is
still
formally
called
the
Republic
of
China
after
Nationalist
forces
fled
there
in
1949
to
escape
advanced
Communist
forces
.

Hu
used
his
anniversary
speech
to
warn
Taiwan
against
ever
pursuing
outright
independence
and
to
call
for
closer
ties
with
the
island
,
which
holds
a
presidential
election
in
January
.

Among
the
guests
in
the
Great
Hall
was
85-year
-
old
former
president
Jiang
Zemin
,
making
a
rare
public
appearance
after
widespread
speculation
in
July
that
he
was
in
failing
health
,
even
near
death
,
after
a
heart
attack
.

COPENHAGEN
,
Oct

(

)
-
Denmark
’s
Max
Bank

was
transferred
into
state
hands
after
it
acknowledged
at
the
weekend
that
it
could
no
longer
meet
requirements
for
further
write
downs
.

Its
operations
were
to
be
transferred
at
the
weekend
to
a
new
subsidiary
under
Finansiel
Stabilitet
,
the
state
authority
set
up
to
handle
failed
Danish
banks
,
Finansiel
Stabilitet
said
in
a
statement
late
Saturday
.

It
would
be
the
10th
bank
to
fall
into
state
hands
since
the
start
of
the
financial
crisis
in
2008
.

The
transfer
of
operations
will
be
made
under
a
recent
adjustment
to
an
existing
government
bank
aid
package
,
and
the
transfer
would
be
effective
on
October
8
,
Finansiel
Stabilitet
said
.

The
bank
would
still
be
able
to
service
its
customers
,
Finansiel
Stabilitet
said
.

Last
month
,
Danish
political
parties
agreed
to
adjust
a
bank
aid
package
to
help
the
Nordic
country
’s
smaller
liquidity
-
squeezed
banks
and
promote
mergers
within
the
sector
.

The
agreement
followed
growing
worries
that
more
small
Danish
banks
could
fail
.

But
it
has
offered
little
guarantee
to
creditors
,
which
has
contributed
to
a
shortage
of
international
funding
to
all
but
a
handful
of
the
country
’s
biggest
banks
.

Also
last
month
,
Denmark
’s
central
bank
threw
a
lifeline
to
the
country

Nearly
200
factories
,
including
one
run
by
Japanese
car
maker
Honda
Motor
Co
Ltd
,
closed
in
the
central
Thai
province
of
Ayutthaya
because
of
flooding
,
which
could
threaten
Bangkok
this
week
,
officials
said
on
Sunday
.

About
261
people
have
died
since
late
July
in
flood
-
related
incidents
,
the
Department
of
Disaster
Prevention
and
Mitigation
said
.

Some
2.3
million
people
have
been
affected
in
the
worst
flooding
to
hit
parts
of
Thailand
in
50
years
,
mainly
in
the
centre
,
north
and
northeast
.

The
Rojana
estate
in
Ayutthaya
province
,
run
by
Rojana
Industrial
Park
Pcl
,
was
flooded
after
a
wall
of
sandbags
failed
to
hold
back
water
overnight
.

“
All
198
factories
at
Rojana
have
to
be
closed
because
the
water
is
about
5.1
metres
high
,
”
Industry
Minister
Wannarat
Channukul
told
Reuters
.

A
Honda
spokeswoman
said
it
had
moved
about
3,000
assembled
cars
from
the
estate
to
other
areas
.

Hana
Microelectronics
Pcl

has
also
had
to
close
its
plant
in
Ayutthaya
.

On
Thursday
the
Center
for
Economic
and
Business
Forecasting
,
part
of
the
University
of
the
Thai
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
cut
its
forecast
for
gross
domestic
product
(
GDP
)
growth
this
year
to
3.6
percent
from
4.4
percent
because
of
the
floods
.

It
put
the
impact
of
the
flooding
at
between
1.0
and
1.3
percentage
points
of
GDP
and
said
its
new
growth
forecast
would
have
been
lower
but
for
recent
strength
in
exports
.

The
commerce
ministry
said
on
Friday
it
had
slashed
its
forecast
for
the
main
rice
crop
,
which
farmers
are
just
starting
to
bring
in
,
to
21
million
tonnes
from
25
million
because
of
the
flooding
.

Thailand
is
the
world
’s
biggest
rice
exporter
.

The
crop
damage
will
add
to
the
pressure
on
export
prices
,
already
being
forced
up
by
the
high
buying
price
set
under
a
government
intervention
scheme
aimed
at
helping
poor
farmers
.

Bangkok
Governor
Sukhumbhand
Paribatra
said
in
a
statement
the
authorities
were
preparing
an
evacuation
plan
to
move
people
from
affected
areas
if
floods
hit
the
capital
,
much
of
which
is
just
two
metres
above
sea
level
.

Some
riverside
areas
have
already
suffered
minor
flooding
but
the
level
of
the
Chao
Phraya
River
could
rise
sharply
from
Oct.
15
-
18
when
a
large
amount
of
water
will
reach
the
area
from
the
north
,
where
dams
are
close
to
overflowing
,
at
a
time
of
high
sea
tides
.

The
government
was
trying
to
accelerate
the
drainage
of
water
from
the
Chao
Phraya
into
the
sea
before
the
high
tide
.

Other
Southeast
Asian
countries
have
suffered
serious
flooding
in
recent
weeks
because
of
heavy
monsoon
rains
combined
with
tropical
storms
.

The
death
toll
from
two
strong
typhoons
that
cut
across
the
north
of
the
Philippines’
main
island
and
left
behind
widespread
flooding
had
risen
to
101
as
of
Sunday
,
the
national
disaster
agency
said
.

At
least
167
people
had
died
in
Cambodia
by
late
last
week
and
15
in
Vietnam
.

Reliance
Capital

said
on
Sunday
it
has
received
$
680
million
from
Nippon
Life

after
its
deal
to
sell
26
percent
stake
in
its
insurance
business
was
completed
.

In
March
,
Reliance
Life
Insurance
—
valued
at
$
2.6
billion
after
the
deal
—
agreed
to
sell
a
26
percent
stake
to
Japan
’s
Nippon
Life
Insurance
.

On
Sept
30
,
Reliance
Capital
got
approval
from
the
Reserve
Bank
of
India
for
the
transaction
,
paving
the
way
for
the
completion
of

Mikey
Welsh
,
former
bassist
for
the
rock
band
Weezer
,
was
found
dead
in
a
Chicago
hotel
room
of
a
suspected
drug
overdose
,
the
Chicago
Tribune
reports
.

Welsh
was
pronounced
dead
at
2:50
p.m.
Saturday
.

His
body
was
discovered
by
staff
at
the
Raffaello
Hotel
when
he
failed
to
meet
the
hotel
's
1
p.m.

time
.

Welsh
played
with
the
band
from
1998
to
2001
.

During
that
period
the
bend
released
the
2001
album
"
Weezer
"
(
commonly
referred
to
as
"
The

Green
Album
"
)
,
which
contained
the
hits
"
Island

the
Sun
"
and
"
Hash

"

Welsh
quit
the
band
in
August
of
that
year
due
to
a
nervous
breakdown
,
and
in
later
years
began
a
career

Anti
-
Wall
Street
demonstrators
said
on
Saturday
they
are
growing
out
of
their
lower
Manhattan
encampment
and
are
exploring
options
to
expand
to
other
public
spaces
in
New
York
City
.

Protesters
complaining
about
what
they
view
as
corporate
greed
have
been
camped
out
near
Wall
Street
in
Zuccotti
Park
for
three
weeks
,
staging
rallies
and
marches
that
have
mostly
proceeded
peacefully
but
have
also
resulted
in
confrontations
with
police
.

On
Saturday
,
several
hundred
protesters
marched
north
to
Washington
Square
Park

—
the
site
of
protests
against
the
Vietnam
War
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
—
to
discuss
expanding
their
encampment
to
other
sites
.

Lucas
Vasquez
,
a
student
who
was
leading
the
march
,
said
protesters
were
looking
at
expanding
into
Washington
Square
and
Battery
parks
,
but
stressed
:
“
We
’re
not
going
to
give
up
Liberty
Plaza

the
protesters’
name
for
Zuccotti
Park
,
where
about
250
have
camped
out
around
the
clock
.

“
It
’s
sometimes
hard
to
move
around
there
.

By
late
on
Saturday
,
no
decision
had
been
reached
.

The
movement
has
surged
in
less
than
three
weeks
from
a
ragged
group
in
downtown
Manhattan
to
protesters
of
all
ages
demonstrating
from
Seattle
to
Tampa
.

The
protesters
object
to
the
Wall
Street
bailout
in
2008
,
which
they
say
left
banks
to
enjoy
huge
profits
while
average
Americans
suffered
under
high
unemployment
and
job
insecurity
.

On
Friday
,
Mayor
Michael
Bloomberg
said
the
protests
“
are
n’t
productive
”
and
bad
for
tourism
,
even
as
he
said
he
was
sympathetic
to
some
of
their
complaints
.

Wall
Street
is
the
pillar
of
the
New
York
state
economy
,
making
up
13
percent
of
tax
contributions
.

The
protests
have
expanded
to
more
than
two
dozen
cities
,
although
outside
New
York
the
crowds
have
been
much
smaller
.

“
We
’re
tired
of
other
people
controlling
-
or
thinking
they
control
-
our
lives
and
our
livelihoods
,
”
said
Kristin
Thompson
,
a
22-year
-
old
pre
-
school
teacher
and
one
of
100
protesters
on
Saturday
in
downtown
Mobile
,
Alabama
.

In
Santa
Fe
,
New
Mexico
,
about
250
protesters
,
lined
the
streets
outside
a
Bank
of
America
branch
,
waving
corporate
-
protest
signs
at
passing
vehicles
.

Participants
said
they
had
been
summoned
via
social
network
Internet
sites
,
labor
organizers
,
liberal
website
MoveOn.org
and
members
of
the
local
Green
Party
.

“
We
are
all
in
this
together
,
”
said
Ramona
Beene
,
45
,
who
owns
a
cake
company
.

She
said
her
two
college
-
age
children
are
“

of
dollars
and
wo
n’t
have
jobs
after
they

Refined
oil
product
stocks
in
China
,
the
world
’s
second
largest
oil
consumer
,
stood
at
11.62
million
tonnes
as
of
Friday
,
edging
up
slightly
from
the
end
of
September
despite
rising
fuel
sales
,
the
top
economic
planner
said
on
Sunday
.

The
oil
product
inventory
saw
a
big
increase
from
a
year
earlier
,
the
National
Development
and
Reform
Commission
said
on
its
website
(
www.ndrc.gov.cn
)
,
but
did
not
give
a
percentage
change
.

Oil
product
sales
at
China
’s
two
oil
majors
,
the
China
National
Petroleum
Corp
(
CNPC
)
and
Sinopec
Group
,
rose
3.8
percent
from
a
year
earlier
to
662,800
tonnes
a
day
during
the
week
-
long
National
Day
holidays
from
Oct.
1
to
7
,
the
commission
said
.

Crude
throughput
at
China
’s
refineries
rose
1.9
percent
from
a
year
ago
to
967,000
tonnes
a
day
,
or
7.06
million
barrels
per
day
(
bpd
)
during
the
week
,
it
said
.

Production
of
gasoline
,
kerosene
and
diesel
held
steady
at
587,000
tonnes
.

However
,
domestic
crude
oil
production
fell
7.2
percent
from
a
year
earlier
to
495,800
tonnes
a
day
,
or
3.62
million
bpd
,
largely
because
of
a
significant
drop
in
offshore
oil
production
,
it
said
.

The
government
in
September
ordered
a
full
shutdown
of
the
country
’s
largest
offshore
oilfield
,
Penglai
19
-

,
after
a
three
-
month
oil
spill
in
Bohai
Bay
by
ConocoPhillips

China
,
operator
of
the
oilfield
.

Maintenance
at
the
Caofeidian
oilfield
in
the
Bohai
Bay
and
a
typhoon
in
the
South
China
Sea
have
also
dragged
on
oil
production
,
it
said

Vladimir
Putin
visits
China
on
Tuesday
in
his
first
foreign
trip
since
revealing
plans
to
reclaim
Russia
’s
presidency
,
addressing
a
challenging
relationship
with
a
giant
neighbor
whose
growth
is
both
an
opportunity
and
a
potential
threat
for
Moscow
.

For
Putin
,
whose
main
focus
has
been
domestic
in
nearly
four
years
as
prime
minister
,
the
trip
sets
in
motion
a
return
to
forefront
of
Russian
foreign
policy
ahead
of
a
March
election
in
which
he
is
expected
to
win
a
six

term
as
president
.

talk

strategic
relations
and

on

,
wrangling
over
a

worth

points
up
the
tough
issues
he
will
confront
in

China

may

to
gauge
Putin
’s

for
what
could
be

last
week
of
a
European
-
drafted
,
U.S
.-
backed
U.N.
Security
Council
resolution
to
condemn
Syria
’s
crackdown
on
pro
-
democracy
protesters
was
a
warning
against
Western
meddling
in
their
own
countries
and
others
worldwide
.

Putin
may
use
the
trip
to
show
the
West
an
emphasis
on
China
as
Russia
’s
geopolitical
partner
and
a
customer
for
its
energy
.

He
did
just
that
in
a
televised
meeting
with
Gazprom
CEO
Alexei
Miller
on
October
3
,
pointedly
ordering
him
to
prepare
proposals
on
expansion
into
Asian
markets
,
seen
as
a
way
to
diversify
Russian
energy
exports
away
from
stagnant
Europe
.

President
Dmitry
Medvedev
has
not
been
cool
to
China
since
Putin
steered
him
into
the
Kremlin
after
his
own
2000
-
2008
presidency
,
but
his
emphasis
has
been
on
presenting
a
friendlier
face
to
the
West
and
improving
ties
with
the
United
States
.

Putin
’s
meeting
with
Miller
followed
European
Commission
raids
on
offices
of
Gazprom
subsidiaries
in
Europe
that
underscored
persistent
tensions
over
the
continent
’s
heavy
reliance
on
Russian
gas
,
which
EU
members
want
to
reduce
.

But
China
’s
friendly
political
ties
with
Russia
,
and
their
partnership
in
the
loose
BRIC
grouping
that
also
includes
India
and
Brazil
,
do
not
make
Beijing
less
of
a
tough
customer
when
it
comes
to
energy
deals
.

Putin
will
likely
seek
to
resolve
the
price
disagreements
that
have
prevented
Russia
nailing
down
a
30-year
deal
to
supply
China
with
up
to
68
billion
cubic
meters
of
gas
per
year
.

But
Gazprom
’s
export
chief
told
Reuters
last
month
that
the
five
-
year
-
old
negotiations
might
not
end
this
year
,
pushing
back
initial
deliveries
beyond
the
latest
target
of
2016
.

Meanwhile
,
China
is
cultivating
other
sources
of
energy
supplies
,
particularly
in
ex
-
Soviet
Central
Asia
.

A
report
this
month
by
the
Stockholm
International
Peace
Research
Institute
(
SIPRI
)
said
China
was
gaining
the
upper
hand
in
the
relationship
as
it
becomes
less
reliant
on
Russia
for
advanced
weapons
and
looks
elsewhere
for
some
of
its
energy
.

It
said
Russia
’s
significance
to
China
would
continue
to
diminish
in
the
coming
years
,
and
that
“
there
are
strategic
planners
in
Beijing
and
Moscow
who
view
the
other
side
as
the
ultimate
strategic
threat
in
the
long
term
.

While
Putin
may
use
China
as
a
foil
against
the
West
,
the
pragmatic
former
KGB
officer
is
well
aware
of
such
concerns
.

As
he
prepares
for
what
could
be
two
six
-
year
terms
as
president
,
“
the
risks
from
China
’s
growth
will
be
watched
more
closely
than
the
opportunities
,
”
said
Fyodor
Lukyanov
,
editor
of
the
journal
Russia
in
Global
Affairs
.

At
an
investor
conference
on
Thursday
,
Putin
used
a
joke
to
play
down
the
challenge
posed
by
China
’s
faster
growth
after
TPG
Capital
co
-
founder
David
Bonderman
outlined
China
’s
path
to
becoming
the
world
’s
largest
economy
.

He
said
that
the
United
States
is
so
far
the
world
’s
biggest
economy
but
China
will
undoubtedly
take
over
.

So
we
now
need
to
keep
our
foreign
currency
reserves
in
yuan
while
the
Chinese
will
keep
them
in
dollars
,
”
Putin
said
.

That
will
be
an
interesting
Russian
doll
.

Evidence
shows
that
quantitative
easing
does
support
the
economy
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
feeds
directly
into
inflation
without
supporting
growth
,
Bank
of
England
policymaker
Martin
Weale
told
Sky
News
on
Sunday
.

The
work
that
the
bank
has
done
on
the
issue
has
suggested
quantitative
easing
does
support
the
economy
,
”
he
told
the
broadcaster
.

When
asked
if
the
state
of
the
economy
would
have
been
worse
if
200
billion
pounds
had
not
been
pumped
in
,
he
said
:
“
I
think
so
.

Obviously
there
is
uncertainty
about
the
exact
impact
,
and
equally
we
do
n’t
know
whether
the
impact
in
the
future
will
be
similar
to
what
we
think
it
was
in
the
past
.

But
I
have
not
heard
anyone
suggesting
that
quantitative
easing
actually
inhibits
the
growth
of
the
economy
,
that
it
fails
to
provide
support
.

Some
people
have
suggested
that
it
translates
fairly
directly
into
inflation
without
supporting
economic
growth
,
and
I
ca
n’t
see
any
reason
why
that
should
be
the
case

,
I
have
n’t
heard
of
a
convincing
mechanism
why
that
should
be
the
case
.

The
Swiss
authorities
have
convened
a
crisis
committee
set
up
after
the
2008
government
bailout
of
UBS

to
discuss
the
possible
impact
on
the
big
banks
of
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
,
the
NZZ
am

newspaper
reported
on
Sunday
.

Citing
two

sources
,
the
newspaper
said
the
committee
had
become
active
as
concerns
mount
that
the
problems
in
the
euro
zone
could
trigger
a
new
financial
crisis
that
would
spread
through
the
banking
sector
again
.

The
committee
is
led
by
Patrick
Raaflaub
,
director
of
the
FINMA
financial
markets
regulator
,
and
also
includes
Fritz
Zurbruegg
,
head
of
the
Swiss
finance
department
,
as
well
as
central
bank
vice
chairman
Thomas
Jordan
,
the
paper
said
.

FINMA
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
on
the
report
.

The
paper
cited
one
source
as
saying
that
while
UBS
and
Credit
Suisse
were
relatively
well
capitalised
,
it
was
not
clear
how
quickly
this
capital
could
be
mobilised
to
cushion
the
shock
of
a
serious
crisis
spreading
through
the
system
.

The
NZZ

quoted
Raaflaub
as
declining
to
comment
on
the
activities
of
the
committee
:
“

A
body
like

committee
can
only
function
by

out
of
the

eye
in
such
phases
.

He
also
declined
to
comment
on
particular
measures
FINMA
was
taking

urged

“
On

UBS
said
last

the
$
2.3

it
lost
in

European
banks
may
need
more
than
100
billion
euros
(
$
135
billion
)
to
withstand
the
sovereign
debt
crisis
,
Ireland
estimated
on
Saturday
ahead
of
a
meeting
between
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
to
work
out
how
to
recapitalize
the
lenders
.

The
falling
value
of
banks’
holdings
of
government
debt
from
Greece
and
other
euro
zone
periphery
states
has
already
provoked
the
implosion
of
Belgian
lender
Dexia
,
adding
urgency
to
the
Merkel
-
Sarkozy
talks
.

There
is
a
high
risk
that
this
crisis
further
escalates
and
broadens
,
”
German
Finance
Minister
Wolfgang
Schaeuble
told
German
paper
Frankfurter
Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung
in
an
interview
released
in
advance
of
publication
on
Sunday
.

Germany
and
France
have
so
far
been
split
over
how
to
strengthen
shaky
lenders
and
fight
financial
market
contagion
that
may
follow
a
possible
Greek
default
.

Paris
is
keen
to
tap
the
euro
zone
’s
400
billion
rescue
fund
,
the
EFSF
,
to
recapitalize
its
own
banks
,
while
Berlin
is
insisting
the
fund
should
be
used
as
a
last
resort
.

The
International
Monetary
Fund
(
IMF
)
has
said
European
banks
need
200
billion
euros
in
additional
funds
.

Irish
Finance
Minister
Michael
Noonan
said
the
capital
needed
to
bolster
banks’
cushions
was
likely
to
come
from
a
variety
of
sources
but
the
total
bill
would
be
large
.

I
think
there
is
general
agreement
that
it
will
be
significantly
in
excess
of
100
billion
(
euros
)
,
”
Noonan
told
reporters
on
the
sidelines
of
an
economic
forum
in
Dublin
.

“
I
know
that
some
of
the
big
German
banks
that
I
was
talking
to
personally
intend
raising
money
on
the
market
so
it
will
be
private
funding
.

Other
banks
would
like
to
avail
of
the
EFSF
fund
.

Other
banks
will
rely
on
their
sovereign
governments
to
provide
the
capital
so
there
is
going
to
be
a
range
of
ways
of
doing
it
,
”
he
said
.

Regulators
worry
that
forcing
a
raft
of
major
lenders
to
take
state
aid
would
not
be
the
best
use
of
Europe
’s
limited
capital
resources
,
while
banks
fear
than
singling
out
only
some
lenders
for
extra
support
could
heighten
market
worries
about
weaknesses
at
individual
banks
.

German
newspaper
Frankfurter
Allgemeine
Zeitung
on
Saturday
cited
financial
sources
as
saying
France
’s
five
-
biggest
lenders
would
agree
to
take
10
-
15
billion
euros
in
funding
from
the
state
but
also
wanted
to
see
Germany

lender
Deutsche
Bank
plump
its
capital
cushion
.

But
a
senior
French
banking
source
shot
down
the
idea
that
French
banks
could
be
pushing
for
state
aid
,
saying
the
Frankfurter
Allgemeine
Zeitung
report
was
baseless
.

I
do
n’t
know
what
game
the
Germans
are
playing
...

This
is
wishful
thinking
,
”
the
source
told
Reuters
,
asking
not
to
be
named
.

Deutsche
Bank
Chief
Executive
Josef
Ackermann
is
against
any
role
for
the
state
in
his
own
bank
’s
capital
position
and
has
ruled
out
a
capital
increase
.

A
Deutsche
Bank
spokesman
on
Saturday
referred
to
Ackermann
’s
long
-
standing
public
position
and
declined
further
comment
.

The
chief
financial
officer
of
Deutsche
Bank
unit
,
Deutsche
Postbank
,
said
he
expected
the
21
percent
haircut
on
Greek
bonds
that
international
banks
agreed
to
take
as
part
of
a
EU
-
brokered
debt
relief
deal
in
July
would
not
be
enough
.

Therefore
we
would
expect
renewed
writedowns
in
the
third
quarter
,
”
Postbank
’s
Marc
Hess
told
Boersen
-
Zeitung
newspaper
.

Banks’
need
to
gird
their
capital
bases
is
also
leading
some
to
merge

such
as

signs
that

with
a

insisting
on
conditions
for

Angry
Greeks
have
taken
to
the
streets
to
protest
government
efforts
to
slash
spending
,
boost
taxes
and
privatize
state
companies
but
Belgian
Finance
Minister

Didier
Reynders
said
the
pain
could
not
go
on
indefinitely
.

This
is
not
acceptable
on
a
political
,
social
or
even
economic
level
:
we
do
not
want
the
cure
to
kill
Greece
,
”
Reynders
told
Greek
newspaper
Proto
Thema
in
an
interview
.

Meanwhile
,
Greece
’s
representative
at
the
IMF
said
the
country
’s
borrowing
needs
will
be
higher
than
currently
projected
due
to
a
tougher
-
than
-
expected
recession
and
the
outcome
of
a
debt
agreement
with
private
sector
creditors
.

“
This
financing
gap
will
have
to
be
covered
either
by
increasing
the
109
billion
euro
loan
agreed
on
July
21
or
through
a
restructuring
of
private
debt
,
”
Panagiotis
Roumeliotis
said
in
an
interview
in
financial
daily
Imerisia
.

EU
leaders
agreed
in
July
to
provide
Greece
with
a
second
bailout
of
more
than
109
billion
euros
to
help
the
country
service
its
debt
through
to
2020

With
their
favored
candidates
for
the
2012
Republican
presidential
nomination
lagging
or
out
of
the
race
,
many
U.S.
Tea
Party
activists
are
shifting
focus
to
the
struggle
for
control
of
the
U.S.
Senate
.

The
fizz
has
gone
out
of
the
presidential
contest
for
some
supporters
of
the
fiscally
conservative
movement
now
that
former
Alaska
governor
Sarah
Palin
is
not
running
and
Texas
Governor
Rick
Perry
and
congresswoman
Michele
Bachmann
are
slipping
in
polls
.

No
one
is
going
to
get
perfect
in
a
general
election
candidate
.

That
is
why
we
think
the
Senate
is
a
better
place
to
focus
,
”
said
Matt
Kibbe
,
president
and
chief
executive
of
the
libertarian
FreedomWorks
,
a
Tea
Party
group
.

In
the
2010
mid
-
term
elections
,
Tea
Party
opposition
to
President
Barack
Obama
’s
policies
played
a
big
role
in
slashing
the
Democrats’
majority
in
the
100-member
Senate
to
just
six
seats
and
eliminating
their
majority
in
the
House
of
Representatives
.

With
23
of
the
33
Senate
seats
up
for
grabs
next
year
now
held
by
Democrats
,
and
a
wave
of
public
hostility
to
incumbents
,
Tea
Party
activists
said
they
looked
forward
to
more
Republican
gains
in
2012
.

“
We
’ll
maintain
the
House
without
a
problem
.

We
absolutely
have
to
take
back
the
Senate
and
focus
on
that
and
not
let
presidential
politics
consume
all
of
our
time
and
energy
,
”
said
Amy
Kremer
,
chairwoman
of
the
California
-
based
Tea
Party
Express
Political
Action
Committee
.

Some
of
the
eight
to
10
Senate
seats
seen
as
very
competitive
next
year
are
in
Wisconsin
,
Florida
and
Ohio
,
states
where
Tea
Party
groups
had
a
big
impact
in
2010
and
during
state
legislative
sessions
,
fueling
optimism
about
next
year
,
Kibbe
said
.

“
If
the
issues
are
the
economy
and
jobs
,
the
burden
of
spending
and
the
national
debt
,
those
are
swing
issues
that
Tea
Partiers
care
about
most
—
there
is
a
nice
confluence
in
what
motivates
independent
voters
and
what
motivates
Tea
Partiers
,
”
he
said
.

Fueling
the
Tea
Party
’s
disenchantment
with
the
Republican
presidential
race
are
suspicions
that
front
-
runner
Mitt
Romney
is
too
moderate
and
not
committed
to
core
conservative
causes
.

The
Tea
Party
favors
lower
spending
and
smaller
government
.

The
former
Massachusetts
governor
has
been
attacked
by
conservatives
for
introducing
a
healthcare
program
in
the
state
that
many
say
was
a
model
for
the
sweeping
healthcare
overhaul
enacted
by
Obama
in
2010
.

“
People
are
definitely
not
rallying
to
Romney
,
”
said
Chris
Littleton
,
co
-
founder
of
the
Ohio
Liberty
Council
,
a
coalition
of
about
80
Tea
Party
groups
in
Ohio
,
a
swing
state
considered
a
must
-
win
for
any
Republican
presidential
candidate
.

“
I
can
not
recall
a
single
conversation
I
’ve
had
with
anyone
who
is
conservative
and
liberty
-
minded
where
that
person
supports
Romney
,
”
he
said
.

Some
are
shifting
allegiance
to
Herman
Cain
,
who
has
gained
in
recent
polls
and
appeals
to
Tea
Party
activists
with
a
plan
to
drastically
overhaul
the
tax
code
,
but
Cain
has
yet
to
prove
he
can
assemble
the
strong
campaign
team
or
attract
the
level
of
donations
he
would
need
to
secure
the
nomination
.

Romney
’s
campaign
said
his
platform
of
reduced
taxes
,
lower
spending
and
limited
government
would
appeal
to
Republicans
,
the
Tea
Party
and
even
some
Democrats
,
and
that
he
would
continue
to
reach
out
to
all
voters
.

In
the
end
,
Tea
Party
voters
are
expected
to
put
aside
ideological
differences
with
Romney
if
he
does
become
the
nominee
,
because
their
primary
goal
in
next
year
’s
presidential
race
is
denying
Obama
a
second
term
.

“
The
Tea
Party
to
some
extent
,
though
not
completely
,
was
born
in
reaction
to
the
Obama
movement
.

Certainly
their
number
one
priority
is
going
to
be
to
beat
Barack
Obama
in
the
fall
.

There
’s
no
question
about
that
,
”
said
Doug
Heye
,
a
political
consultant
and
former
Republican
National
Committee
spokesman
.

Sal
Russo
,
chief
strategist
and
co
-
founder
of
the
Tea
Party
Express
,
said
he
viewed
all
the
Republican
candidates
as
fiscally
conservative
enough
for
the
Tea
Party
.

Besides
,
he
added
,
in
the
end
the
movement
’s
supporters
want
a
candidate
who
can
win
.

“
It
certainly
does
n’t
do
us
any
good
to
run
and
lose
,
”
he
said
.

Here
are
some
details
of
the
69-year
-
old

life
:

—
Paul
McCartney
,
John

first
played

recorded
with
his
group
Wings
in

,
topped
the
British
charts
for
nine
weeks
.

Though
he
delivered
another
standard
McCartney
pop
-
rock
album
in
1993
,
“
Off
the
Ground
,
”
McCartney
was
starting
to
experiment
with
other
genres
.

In
1991
he
composed
the
“
Liverpool
Oratorio
,
”
later
performed
by
the
London
Symphony
Orchestra
.

Other

into
classical
music

health
officer
,
died
suddenly
when

.

—

he
qualified
for

pop
music
dictated
his
future
.

met
at
15
,
he
began
learning
the
guitar
.

couple
blamed
their
split
on
media
intrusion
into
their
private
lives

,

ended

’s
bid
to
become
the
first
man
since
Pete
Sampras
in
1993
-

to
retain
the

crown
.

I
played
some
great
tennis
,
especially
in
the
third
set
,
”
Murray
told
reporters
after
inflicting
the
dreaded
‘
bagel’
on
Nadal
in
the
decider
to
win
his
20th
career
title
.

“
It
was
the
best
tennis
I
’ve
played
against
Rafa
,

”
added
the
Scot
,
who
had
lost
13
of
his
previous
17
matches
against
the
world
number
two
.

Murray
,
who
has
won
21
of
his
last
22
matches
,
will
wish
he
could
bottle
the
magic
he
produced
in
an
astonishing
third
set
,
when
he
dropped
just
four
points
.

“
To
only
lose
four
points
-
and
against
Rafa
-
will
never
happen
again
,
”
he
said
.

I
’ve
hit
the
ball
like
that
before
but
for
such
a
long
period
,
that
’s
definitely
the
first
time
.

“
I
’ve
given
myself
the
target
of
ending
the
year
at
number
three
(
in
the
world
)

so
hopefully
I
can
carry
on
that
form
.
”

Murray
,
who
can
close
the
gap
on
Roger
Federer
further
in
Shanghai
next
week
,
returned
to
court
after
a
quick

to
win
the

“
Winning
with
my

the
singles
trophy
gleaming
beside
him
.

Top
seed
Nadal
took
the
first
set
on
a
superb
lunging
volley
but
Murray
hit
back
brilliantly
,
breaking
for
3
-
1
in
the
second
with
a
rifled
forehand
into
the
corner
.

Murray
,
accused
in
the
past
of
having
a
‘
glass
jaw’
,
nervelessly
saved
triple
break
point
in
the
next
game
with
three
cracking
aces
to
leave
Nadal
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
.

The
second
seed
,
who
had
been
screaming
at
himself
and
pointing
furiously
at
his
box
in
the
first
set
,
leveled
the
match
with
a
bullet
backhand
that
Nadal
could
only
dump
into
the
net
.

Nadal
’s
game
unraveled
and
the
10-times
grand
slam
champion
wore
the
look
of
a
tortured
man
in
the
final
set
as
Murray
caught
fire
,
ripping
winner
after
winner
past
him
.

Nadal
overtook
world
number
one
Novak
Djokovic
for
most
match
wins
this
year
with
his
65th
in
his
semi
-
final
victory
over
Mardy
Fish
,
but
he
had
no
answer
to
Murray
’s
power
.

Fans
of
Nadal
,
many
draped
in
Spanish
flags
and
some
in
red
-
and
-
yellow
,
afro
-
style
wigs
,
fell
silent
as
Murray
tore
through
the
decider
in
29
minutes
.

Murray
set
up
triple
match
point
with
a
rocket
forehand
down
the
line
before
forcing
Nadal
into
a
loose
backhand
to
end
a
pulsating
final
after
two
hours
,
16
minutes
.

He
deserves
the
title
,
”
said
Nadal
,
playing
his
first
tournament
since
helping
Spain
to
reach
the
Davis
Cup
final
last
month
.

“
I
’ve
lost
a
few
sets
6
-
0
of
course
.

You
prefer
it
does
n’t
happen
,
but
he
played
fantastic
and
in
the
third
set
he
started
to
play
at
a
really
high
level

LONDON
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Evidence
shows
that
quantitative
easing
boosts
the
economy
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
feeds
directly
into
inflation
without
supporting
growth
,
Bank
of
England
policymaker
Martin
Weale
told
Sky
News
on
Sunday
.

The
work
that
the
bank
has
done
on
the
issue
has
suggested
quantitative
easing
does
support
the
economy
,
”
the
external
Monetary
Policy
Committee
member
told
the
broadcaster
.

Obviously
there
is
uncertainty
about
the
exact
impact
,
and
equally
we
do
n’t
know
whether
the
impact
in
the
future
will
be
similar
to
what
we
think
it
was
in
the
past
,
”
he
said
when
asked
if
the
state
of
the
economy
would
have
been
worse
if
the
bank
had
not
bought
200
billion
pounds

(
$
312
billion)of
financial
assets
,
mostly
gilts
,
between
March
2009
and
January
2010
.

The
Bank
of
England
(
BoE
)
voted
on
Thursday
to
buy
75
billion
pounds
more
in
assets
to
shield
Britain
’s
economy
from
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
and
keep
the
faltering
recovery
going
.

Some
people
have
suggested
that
it
translates
fairly
directly
into
inflation
without
supporting
economic
growth
,
and
I
ca
n’t
see
any
reason
why
that
should
be
the
case
,
”
Weale
said
.

“
Obviously
the
future
is
uncertain
and
we
do
n’t
know
how

much
support
will
be
provided

but
I
certainly
think
it
is
an

appropriate
response
to
a
weakening
economic
(
situation
)
.

In
August
,
Weale
ditched
his
call
for
a
rate
hike
.

“
There
is
quite
a
lot
of
scope
for
further
quantitative
easing
,
”
he
said
.

“
Before
the
purchases
that
we
announced
last
week
,
the
amount
of
government
debt
in
the
system
was
actually
higher
than
it
had
been
before
the
earlier
bout
of
quantitative

easing
.
”

Thursday
’s
decision
to
expand
its
asset
purchase
programme
to
a
total
of
275
billion
pounds
highlights
the
precarious
state
of
Britain
’s
economy
as
global
growth
slows
,
government
spending
cuts
and
tax
hikes
bite
and
consumers
face
high
inflation
and
slow
wage
rises
.

Weale
told
Sky
the
bank
could
not
be
expected
to
reach
its
2
percent
inflation
target
in
the
very
short
term
without
a
very
tight
squeeze
on
the
economy
,
“
and
I
have
n’t
heard
anyone
thinking
that
’s
a
good
idea
.
”

The
horizon
we
work
to
is
a
two
to
three
-
year
horizon
,
and
with
the
economy
having
weakened
now
,
that
means
that
inflation
prospects
in
two
to
three
years’
time
(
are
)
less
worrying
than
I
had
thought
they
were
,
and
so
that
justifies
a
slacker
policy
,
”
he
added
.

On
Friday
,
Moody
’s
cut
the
credit
rating
of
some
British
banks
due
to
the
likelihood
of
less
state
support
in
a
future
crisis
.

“
It
’s
not
reflecting
problems
with
Britain
’s
banks
,
”
Weale
added
.

Poland
voted
in
a
parliamentary
election
on
Sunday
that
could
give
Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
’s
centre
-
right
Civic
Platform
four
more
years
in
power
to
pursue
gradual
economic
reforms
and
preserve
political
stability
.

Civic
Platform
,
which
guided
Poland
through
the
2008
-
2009
financial
crisis
and
favours
closer
ties
with
the
rest
of
the
European
Union
,
would
be
the
first
party
to
hold
on
to
power
in
an
election
in
Poland
since
the
collapse
of
Communism
in
1989
.

Opinion
polls
show
no
party
will
win
an
outright
majority
and
another
four
years
of
coalition
government
are
likely
in
the
country
of
more
than
38
million
people
after
Civic
Platform
’s
four
-
year
alliance
with
the
Peasants’
Party
.

The
polls
put
outspoken
ex
-
premier
Jaroslaw
Kacynski
’s
conservative
-
nationalist
Law
and
Justice
party
in
second
place
.

His
return
to
power
after
four
years
in
opposition
could
strain
ties
with
Russia
and
Germany
but
is
widely
considered
unlikely
because
his
party
would
struggle
to
forge
a
coalition
.

Tusk
,
54
,
portrays
himself
as
a
guardian
of
stability
.

A
mild
-
mannered
pragmatist
with
a
common
touch
,
he
has
eschewed
radical
economic
reforms
,
avoided
talk
of
austerity
despite
a
large
budget
deficit
and
promised
to
continue
cautious
reforms
.

Law
and
Justice
has
promised
more
state
involvement
in
the
economy
,
including
a
bank
tax
and
higher
taxes
for
the
rich
,
and
vowed
to
wind
down
large
-
scale
privatisation
.

“
PO
(
Civic
Platform
)
should
continue
to
govern
because
they
have
done
a
great
deal
.

Just
look
at
the
roads
,
”
said
Maria
Mlodzikowska
,
an
80-year
-
old
retired
physical
education
teacher
,
after
voting
in
Warsaw
.

But
Jan
Mazur
,
a
74-year
-
old
retired
printer
,
said
he
had
voted
for
Law
and
Justice
for
the
sake
of
his
grandchildren
.

“
I
do
n’t
want
them
to
grow
up
in
a
country
which
owns
nothing
because
the
PO
has
sold
everything
off
under
the
pretext
of
what
they
call
privatisation
,
”
he
said
.

More
than
30
million
people
are
eligible
to
vote
.

They
will
elect
460
lawmakers
in
the
lower
house
,
the
Sejm
,
and
100
to
the
upper
chamber
,
the
Senate
.

Voting
started
at
7
a.m.
(
0500
GMT
)
and
ends
at
9
p.m.
(
1900
GMT
)
,
when
the
first
exit
polls
will
be
released
.

The
official
result
will
take
several
hours
to
come
in
.

Police
said
two
polling
stations
in
the
eastern
city
of
Lublin
were
closed
because
of
a
bomb
scare
but
there
were
no
other
reports
of
problems
across
the
NATO
member
state
.

Ratings
agencies
say
they
could
downgrade
Poland
if
it

does
not
swiftly
act
to
reduce
the
budget
deficit
,
expected
to
reach
5.6
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
this
year
,
and
the
public
debt
,
expected
to
reach
53.8
percent
of
GDP
this
year
.

Economists
doubt
Law
and
Justice
would
be
able
to
meet
the
challenge
.

The
current
coalition
,
however
,
has
failed
to
deliver
on
promises
of
far
-
reaching
liberal
market
reforms
.

The
EU
’s
largest
former
communist
economy
has
lost
some
of
its
lustre
since
2007
when
Tusk
took
power
,
but
Poland
was
the
only
EU
state
to
maintain
positive
growth
through
the
turmoil
of
2008
-
2009
and
growth
is
estimated
at
4
percent
this
year
.

The
Euro
2012
soccer
championship
,
which
Poland
will
co
-
host
with
Ukraine
,
should
also
boost
demand
.

If
Tusk
wins
but
can
not
forge
a
strong
coalition
with
just
the
Peasants’
Party
,
he
may
have
to
turn
to
Palikot
’s
Movement
,
a
new
party
that
supports
gay
rights
,
abortion
and
legalisation
of
soft
drugs
for
support
.

Led
by
Janusz
Palikot
,
a
wealthy
businessman
and
former
Civic
Platform
lawmaker
,
the
party
has
criticised
Poland
’s
powerful
Catholic
Church
.

“
I
support
Palikot
...
at
least
he
’ll
be
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
the
stiflingly
stodgy
Sejm
,
”
said
Krystyna
Celinska
,
a
28-year
-
old
graphic
artist
.

Tusk
favours
deeper
EU
integration
despite
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
and
has
sought
stable
ties
with
Russia
and
Germany
,
its
largest
and
most
powerful
neighbours
.

Kaczynski
,
62
,
deeply
distrusts
the
countries
which
carved
up
Poland
under
a
Nazi
-
Soviet
pact
before
World
War
Two
and
also
raised
eyebrows
during
the
election
campaign
by
repeating
in
a
new
book
his
view
that
Berlin
is
trying
to
subdue
Poland
.

“
I
back
PiS
(
Law
and
Justice
)
because
they
put
Poland
’s
interests
ahead
of
those
of
Brussels
or
Berlin
,
”
said
Maria
Derkacz
,
a
translator
in
her
early
60s
.

Tusk
has
continued
the
rapprochement
with
Moscow
,
which
held
sway
over
Poland
for
decades
after
World
War
Two
,
despite
a
setback
since
a
plane
crash
last
year
killed
then
-
President
Lech
Kaczynski
,
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
twin
,
and
95
others
.

Moscow
says
mistakes
by
Polish
pilots
were
the
sole
cause
of
the
crash
.

Warsaw
believes
Russian
ground
controllers
also
played
a
role
in
the
tragedy
and
Kaczynski
says
Tusk
and
Russian
Prime
Minister
Vladimir
Putin
bore
some
responsibility
.

but
he
will
prevent
Kaczynski
getting
into
power
,

said
Andrzej
Antczak
,
a
42-year

old

specialist
.

Online
gaming
firm
Sportingbet

is
close
to
agreeing
the
sale
of
its
Turkish
gambling
business
to
GVC
,
clearing
an
obstacle
to
Ladbrokes’

takeover
of
the
company
,
according
to
the
Sunday
Times
.

AIM
-
listed
GVC
revealed
in
August
that
it
was
in
exclusive
talks
to
buy
Sportingbet
’s
Turkish
-
language
website
.

A
disposal
of
the
business
would
pave
the
way
for
Ladbrokes
to
buy
Sportingbet
to
strengthen
its
online
offering
.

Ladbrokes
has
been
in
talks
with
Sportingbet
since
June
,
but
the
business
in
Turkey
,
where
unlicensed
websites
are
illegal
,
was
seen
by
analysts
as
a
stumbling
block
.

The
high
-
street
bookmaker
,
which
has
until
Oct.
17
to
table
a
bid
for
Sportingbet
,
has
pulled
out
of
previous
deals
because
of
its
aversion
to
operating
in
unregulated
territories
.

A
spokesman
for
Sportingbet
said
talks
with
both
companies
were
ongoing
.

American
Rickie
Fowler
won
his
first
professional
golf
title
with
a
six
-
stroke
victory
over
U.S.
Open
champion
Rory
McIlroy
in
the
Korea
Open
in
Cheonan
on
Sunday
.

The
long
-
haired
Californian
,
one
of
golf
’s
most
exciting
young
prospects
,
carded
a
three
-
under

par
68
in
the
final
round
at
the
Woo
Jeong
Hills
Country
Club
for
a
four
-
day
total
of
16-under
268
.

I
played
well
early
on
in
the
final
round

and
then
I
was
comfortable
over
the
last
few
holes
.

Overall
,
I
enjoyed
the
whole
week
,
”
the
22-year
-
old
Fowler
told
reporters
.

World
number
three
McIlroy
,
tied
for
fourth
overnight
,
clinched
second
spot
with
a
superb
closing
round
of
seven
-
under
64
,
ahead
of
South
Korea
’s
Kim
Meen
-
whee
and
compatriot
Y.E.
Yang
,
third
and
fourth
respectively
.

It
feels
great
to
have
the
first
win
,
”
said
Fowler
.

I
played
well
all
week
,
although
I
did
have
to
hang
in
on
Friday
and
post
a
score
.

But
on
Thursday
,
Saturday
and
Sunday
I
had
good
control
of
my
ball
,
I
drove
well
and
I
made
some
putts
.
”

Fowler
never
slipped
from
the
top
of
the
leaderboard
over
the
four
days
and
said
his
consistency
was
the
main
factor
behind
his
first
title
.

“
I
’m
happy
with
the
way
I
have
played
on
the
PGA
Tour
,
but
I
have
never
shot
low
enough
to
win
,
”
he
added
.

This
week
I
played
well
for
four
rounds
which
I
have
not
been
able
to
do
in
the
past
.

Winning
a
title
on
the
PGA
Tour
and
a
place
in
the
Ryder
Cup
team
would
top
his
agenda
for
next
year
,
he
said
.

“
I
am
looking
forward
to
some
time
off

and
then
I
can
look
at
everything
and
set
some
goals
for
next
year
.

I
will
play
mainly
on
the
PGA
Tour
next
year

and
I
would
like
to
get
my
first
win
there
,
and
this
win
will
definitely
help
me
achieve
that
.

“
I
also
have
n’t
made
the
Tour
Championship
in
the
last
two
years
,
so
that
is
another
goal
for
next
year
.

But
the
biggest
goal
is
to
make
sure
I
make
the
Ryder
Cup
team
.
”

Northern
Irishman
McIlroy
said
he
had
been
happy
with
his
finish
but
added
:
“
All
the
damage
was
done
during
the
third
round
with
a
couple
of
bad
holes
in
the
middle
of
the
round
.

“
Looking
back
on
this
week
,
I
will
rue
my
third
round
,
which
could
have
been
a
lot
better
.

“
If
I
had
played
a
little
better
and
shot
a
few
under
I
might
have
had
a
chance
,
but
Rickie
has
played
fantastic
this
week
and
he
deserves
the
win
.

A
Greek
default
would
have
unforeseeable
consequences
and
cause
the
euro
zone
crisis
to
spread
,
European
Commission
President
Jose
Manuel
Barroso
was
quoted
as
saying
in
mass
-
selling
Bild
daily
.

Talks
are
continuing
over
a
vital
aid
tranche
for
debt
-
stricken
Athens
,
which
could
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
,
dragging
the
euro
zone
deeper
into
a
debt
crisis
already
shaking
financial
markets
worldwide
.

“
If
we
give
up
on
Greece
,
there
is
a
big
danger
that
the
crisis
will
spread
to
other
countries
,
”
Barroso
told
Bild
in
an
interview
to
be
published
on
Monday
,
echoing
comments
of
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
.

Merkel
warned
last
week
the
threat
of
contagion
from
a
euro
zone
state
rescheduling
its
debt
would
be
huge
and
only
made
sense
once
it
had
achieved
a
primary
surplus
.

Barroso
noted
the
euro
zone
had
no
experience
with
the
possible
bankruptcy
of
a
member
state
.

This
is
new
territory
for
us
and
we
are
discussing
solutions
which
have
not
really
been
tested
before
,
”
he
said
.

But
the
European
Union
was
convinced
that
a
Greek
bankruptcy
was
“
not
cheaper
for
all
participants
than
the
current
aid
schemes
,
”
he
said
.

European
finance
ministers
are
considering
making
banks
take
bigger
losses
on
Greek
debt
—
an
issue
that
could
be
discussed
at
a
meeting
between
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
later
on
Sunday
.

It
is
still
uncertain
whether
Greece
,
which

Barroso

after

caused
by

the

in

statement
late

The
Brakspruit
bridge
in

was
damaged
last

Transnet
had

This
is
46
percent
more
than
what
was
achieved
during

the

Transnet
said
it

BERLIN
(

)
-
Greece
is
at
a
crossroads
and
will
need
to
implement
“
much
stricter
structural
reforms
”
than
seen
so
far
,
IMF
mission
chief
to
Greece
Poul
Thomsen
was
quoted
as
saying
by
a
German
paper
on
Saturday
.

The
gloomy
comments
suggested
the
IMF
was
still
unsure
whether
current
talks
on
a
vital
aid
tranche
for
Athens
would
conclude
positively
,
given
doubts
over
Greece
’s
willingness
to
reform
and
the
impact
of
Greek
strikes
and
riots
.

“
Greece
is
at
a
crossroads
,
”
he
was
quoted
as
saying
by
Welt
am
Sonntag
.

It
is
clear
the
programme
will
not
work
if
the
authorities
do
not
take
the
path
that
requires
much
stricter
structural
reforms
than
those
that
we
have
seen
so
far
.
”

The
IMF
on
Friday
dismissed
a
statement
by
the
Greek
government
that
the
deal
on
aid
was
already
completed
.

It
is
going
two
steps
forward
,
and
one
backwards
,
”
Thomsen
said
.

The
Greek
government
understands
that
many
of
the
most
difficult
changes
lie
ahead
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
political
and
social
fatigue
is
growing
.
”

Athens
could
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
without
the
new
eight
billion
euro
aid
installment
,
increasing
the
risk
of
a
default
that
would
drag
the
euro
zone
deeper
into
a
debt
crisis
already
shaking
financial
markets
worldwide
.

Inspectors
from
the
IMF
,
the
European
Commission
and
the
European
Central
Bank
—
known
as
the
troika
—
resumed
last
week
their
review
of
Greece
’s
progress
under
a
multi
-
billion
euro
bailout
,
after
leaving
Athens
four
weeks
before
over
disagreements
on
how
to
put
its
finances
back
on
track
.

The
Greeks
believe
it
is
enough
to
make
laws
,
”
the
EU
Commission
’s
Matthias
Mors
told
the
Welt
am
Sonntag
.

And
often
the
right
structures
are
lacking
,
for
example
in
tax
administration
.

A
senior
troika
official
told
Reuters
on
Wednesday
that
the
inspectors
were
likely
to
give
the
green
light
to
the
aid
but
that
it
was
not
assured
.

The
EU
and
IMF
first
want
to
receive
more
details
on
the
implementation
and
impact
of
plans
announced
last
month
to
slash
the
public
sector
workforce
and
increase
taxes
to
plug
a
bigger
-
than
-
targeted
fiscal
gap
,
the
official
said
.

Talks
between
Greece
and
the
troika
will
continue
on
Sunday
,
focusing
on
the
country
’s
deficit
cut
plan
for
2013
and
2014
,
a
finance
ministry
official
said
on
condition
of
anonymity
after
a
further
,
four
-
hour
negotiating
round
between
Finance
Minister
Evangelos
Venizelos
and
the
EU
/
IMF
inspectors
.

Athens
shocked
financial
markets
by
announcing
that
it
would
miss
2011
deficit
targets
set
as
conditions
of
a
bailout
aimed
at
staving
off
bankruptcy
,
despite
a
series
of
tax
hikes
and
spending
cuts
.

Thomsen
said
he
had
never
seen
riots
against
austerity
measures
as
intense
as
in
Greece
.

“
People
express
their
frustration
sometimes
in
very
unpleasant
ways
,
”
he
said
.

That
is
one
of
the
ugly
aspects
of
my
work
.

And
the
intensity
of
it
here
is
new
for
me
.

EU
leaders
will
meet
in
Brussels
on
October
17
-
18
to
discuss
revising
a
July
21
deal
to
provide
Greece
with
a
second
rescue
package
.

They
may
ask
investors
to
accept
losses
on
their
holdings
of
Greek
debt
even
larger
than
the
21
percent
write
-
down
set
out
in
the
July
deal
.

A
leading
member
of
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
’s
conservatives
told
a
paper
on
Saturday
Greece
was
near
bankruptcy
and
must
give
up
part
of
its
sovereignty
to
obtain
the
large
debt
forgiveness
it
needs
to
survive
.

Michael
Fuchs
,
a
deputy
parliamentary
floor
leader
for
Merkel
’s

Christian
Democrats
(
CDU
)
,
also
told
Greek
newspaper
“
Real
News
”
that
the
debt
-
laden
country
might
be
better
off
outside
the
euro
zone

its

despite
an

lawsuit
by
the
Obama

deal

Deutsche

The

came

everyone

for
the

as
well
as
both
sides

”
Rene

But
we
are
pushing

determinedly
with

are
optimistic
that
in
the
end
we
will
be
able
to
carry
out
this
merger
,
”
Obermann
added

The
sale
of
T
-
mobile
is
likely
to
spur
activity
in
the
U.S.
mobile
phone
market
,
Obermann
said
.

“
It
will
fire
up
competition
in
the
United
States
because
it
will
boost
network
capacity
and
that
is
the
basis
for
price
competition
,
”
he
said
.

The
merger
creates
advantages
for
all
participants
and
that
is
why
it
will
go
through
,
I
remain
very
confident
of
it
.
”

The
U.S.
Justice
Department
has
sued
to
block
AT&T
’s
$
39
billion
purchase
of
T
-
Mobile
over
worries
it
would
squelch
competition
and
innovation
as
well
as
lead
to
higher
prices
.

A
key
government
concern
is
that
T
-
Mobile
,
the
No
.
4
wireless
carrier
,
generally
costs
less
than
other
carriers
so
its
disappearance
could
mean
higher
prices
for
wireless
service
.

T

Mobile
and
AT&T
,
the
No

2
wireless
carrier
that
would
vault
to
market
leader
if
the
sale
goes

COPENHAGEN
(
Reuters
)
-
Denmark
’s
Max
Bank
was
transferred
into
state
hands
after
it
acknowledged
at
the
weekend
that
it
could
no
longer
meet
requirements
for
further
write
downs
.

Its
operations
were
to
be
transferred
at
the
weekend
to
a
new
subsidiary
under
Finansiel
Stabilitet
,
the
state
authority
set
up
to
handle
failed
Danish
banks
,
Finansiel
Stabilitet
said
in
a
statement
late
Saturday
.

It
would
be
the
10th
bank
to
fall
into
state
hands
since
the
start
of
the
financial
crisis
in
2008
.

The
transfer
of
operations
will
be
made
under
a
recent
adjustment
to
an
existing
government
bank
aid
package
,
and
the
transfer
would
be
effective
on
October
8
,
Finansiel
Stabilitet
said
.

The
bank
would
still
be
able
to
service
its
customers
,
Finansiel
Stabilitet
said
.

Last
month
,
Danish
political
parties
agreed
to
adjust
a
bank
aid
package
to
help
the
Nordic
country
’s
smaller
liquidity
-
squeezed
banks
and
promote
mergers
within
the
sector
.

The
agreement
followed
growing
worries
that
more
small
Danish
banks
could
fail
.

But
it
has
offered
little
guarantee
to
creditors
,
which
has
contributed
to
a
shortage
of
international
funding
to
all
but
a
handful
of
the
country
’s
biggest
banks
.

Also
last
month
,
Denmark
’s
central
bank
threw
a
lifeline
to
the
country
’s
liquidity
-
squeezed
banks
by
offering
a
new
six
-
month
loan
based
on
its
main
lending
rate
and
expanding
the
scope
of
collateral
that
it
accepts
from
banks
.

Max
Bank
reported
a
net
loss
of
60.3
million
Danish
crowns
(
$
10.8
million
)
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
following
79.2
million
crowns
of
write
downs
,
but
kept
its
2011
outlook
of
a
80
million
to
100
million
crowns
profit
.

capacity
at
their
picturesque
Craven

“
Fulham

unprecedented
success
both
on
and
off

in
recent

”
the

’s

Alistair
Mackintosh
said
in

.

“
We
are
confident
a
redevelopment
will
improve
the
fans
matchday
experience
...
whilst
remaining
sympathetic
to
the
design
of
this
historic
ground
.

Fulham
have
played
at
the
Cottage
by
the
banks
of
the
River
Thames
,
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
attractive
and
traditional
grounds
in

,
since
1896
.

Last
week
Chelsea
,
who
play
at
Stamford

,
two
kilometres
from
Craven
Cottage
,
said
they
were
looking
at
options
to
move
from
the
ground
which
has
been
their
home
since
they
were
formed
in
1905
.

Argentine
President
Cristina
Fernandez
has
a
massive
lead
over
opponents
two
weeks
before
a
presidential
election
and
looks
set
to
win
more
than
50
percent
of
the
vote
,
two
polls
showed
on
Sunday
.

Fernandez
’s
support
now
stands
at
53.2
percent
,
according
to
the
latest
monthly
survey
by
local
pollsters
Management
&
Fit
showed
.

That
puts
her
more
than
40
points
ahead
of
her
nearest
rival
,
Socialist
provincial
governor
Hermes
Binner
.

A
Poliarquia
poll
for
leading
daily
La
Nacion
gave
support
of
49.3
percent
but
a
projected
vote
of
between
52
percent
and
55
percent
considering
voters
who
are
still
undecided
.

Center
-
leftist
Fernandez
won
just
over
50
percent
of
votes
in
an
August
primary
,
which
was
seen
as
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
October
23
election
because
all
parties
had
already
anointed
their
candidates
and
voters
could
choose
among
them
.

Binner
has
voter
support
of
12.4
percent
,
up
from
11.6
percent
last
month
and
consolidating
his
position
as
Fernandez
’s
nearest
rival
,
Management
&
Fit
’s
survey
showed
.

The
Poliarquia
poll
also
put
Binner
in
second
place
with
support
of
13.6
percent
and
a
projected
vote
of
between
14
percent
and
16
percent
.

Trailing
in
third
in
both
polls
was
Ricardo
Alfonsin
,
a
social
democratic
legislator
,
who
had
support
of
7.8
percent
and
9.5
percent
in
the
polls
.

Management

’s
survey
showed
San

provincial
governor
Alberto
Rodriguez
Saa
fourth
on
7.4
percent
while
Poliarquia
’s
poll
gave
him
support
of
8.2
percent
.

Rodriguez
Saa
is
a
dissident
member
of
Fernandez
’s
Peronist
party
.

Fernandez
,
who
chose
Economy
Minister
Amado
Boudou
as
her
vice
presidential
candidate
,
vows
to
continue
current
policies
that
include
a
strong
state
hand
in
the
economy
,
hefty
energy
and
transportation
subsidies
and
trade
protectionism
.

She
is
enjoying
approval
ratings
of
more
than
60
percent
thanks
to
brisk
economic
growth
,
the
opposition
’s
failure
to
mount
a
convincing
challenge
and
public
sympathy
following
the
death
a
year
ago
of
her
husband
and
predecessor
as
president
,
Nestor

.

Under
Argentine
election
law
,
candidates
are
guaranteed
a
first

round
victory
if
they
win
more
than
45

was
taken

The
margin

in

is

what
's
your
take
?

Were
Gus
and
Max
friends
so
close
that
they
were
like
brothers

hermanos
?

I
think
the
magic
of
really
good
television
is
to
allow
the
audience
to
draw
their
own
conclusion
.

Certainly
,
there
is
a
deep
and

.

My
father
kissed
me
on
the
lips
my
whole
life
,
or
cheek
to
cheek
.

Is
that
looked
at
oddly
in
America
?

I
would
think
that
Gus
has
those
same
sensibilities
.

I
would
go
for
the
professional
aspect
of
it
,
to
be
honest
with
you
,
that
he
really
cares
about
another
human
being
.

Being
that
this
is
a
guy
he
took
off
the
street
,
put
through
school
and
trained
him
to
be
a
chemist
,
to
have
his
life
dream
come
true
,
even
though
it
played
into
what
Gus
wanted
,
is
more
important
than
whether
they
were
lovers
or
not
.

Could
they
very
possibly
have
been
sleeping
together
?

I
mean
,
James
Martinez
(
the
actor
who
played
Max
)
is
a
beautiful
man
.

He
plays
the
role
so
beautifully
and
seamlessly
that
it
allowed
all
of
those
thoughts
to
happen
.

I
think
that
's
what
makes
it
great
.

To
label
it
,
to
name
it
,
to
know
,
I
think
it
's
much
less
interesting
.

It
's
certainly
and
surely
possible
.

Would
it
have
been
possible
if
they
got
a
really
ugly
actor
to
play
that
guy
?

How
defined
was
the
character
of
Gus
when
you
signed
on
for
the
show
?

Was
it
written
on
the
page
that
you
would
play
him
as
this
deliberate
man
,
or
did
you
make
all
these
choices
about
how
to
portray
him
?

I
hate
to
take
all
of
the
credit
for
what
I
do
,
because
the
writing
is
so
stellar
and
I
pay
such
close
attention
to
everything
that
's
written
,
including
the
stage
directions
.

I
come
from
theater
and
they
say
,
'
Do
n't
read
the
stage
directions
.
'

In
'
Breaking
Bad
,
'
I
read
every
stage
direction
,
because
I
think
everything
really
is
information
for
me
to
take
further
.

In
the
beginning
,
it
was
n't
defined
.

He
appeared
to
be
the
manager
of
this
chicken
restaurant
,
but
I
always
read
into
it
that
he
was
keeping
a
very
big
secret
,
even
if
he
was
n't
.

They
did
n't
know
if
I
was
going
to
go
more
than
one
guest
spot
episode
or
two
.

I
think
if
you
ask
Vince
Gilligan
,
they
did
n't
think
that
I
would
go
four
.

That
was
n't
in
their
consciousness
.

Questions
Answered
in
the
Season
Premiere

How
did
the
character
become
integral
to
the
story
?

What
happened
was
that
I
was
asked
to
do
that
guest
spot
.

Within
a
couple
of
days
of
me
finishing
the
first
one
,
they
said
,
'
Would
you
come
back
and
do
the
season
ender
?
'

Then
they
came
back
and
said
,
'
Would
you
do
more
?
'

I
said
yeah
,
I
would
,
but
not
as
a
guest
star
.

They
asked
me
to
do
seven
more
guest
spots
,
and
I
said
,
'
No
,
I
'm
not
interested
in
that
.

I
'm
interested
in
really
finding
out
who
this
character
is
.
'

I
prefaced
all
of
that
by
saying
that
I
loved
the
show
.

I
adore
and
think
that
Vince
Gilligan
is
brilliant
.

But
I
do
n't
want
to
just
come
in
and
out
…

I
want
to
come
in
and
have
a
full
canvas
to
work
with
,
and
I
expressed
that
.

I
wound
up
doing
11
,
which
was
a
clear
indication
…
of
their
trust
and
devotion
to
doing
what
I
previously
had
asked
for
,
which
was
to
be
able
to
create
a
complete
character
and
to
be
part
of
a
family
.

But
again
,
Gus
was
just
a
nice
guy
who
worked
in
the
chicken
joint
,
who
probably
had
some
secrets
,
and
they
were
hoping
to
uncover
some
of
that
.

I
am
in
gratitude
that
they
found
,
through
my
performance
,
that
they
would
like
to
uncover
a
whole
lot
more
.

Which
they
definitely
did
,
especially
,
as
we
discussed
,
in
the
"
Hermanos
"
episode
.

It
was
so
satisfying
for
viewers
to
get
a
glimpse
at
what
motivates
Gus
…

did
you
feel
that
way
,
too
,
when
you
read
the
script
?

I
've
done
other
shows
and
other
series
,
and
they
go
along
,
and
you
have
a
dual
thing
going
on
,
where
you
want
to
be
able
to
be
on
something
that
's
quality
,
and
to
make
some
money
and
feed
your
family
.

Then
,
once
(
your
character
)
gets
your
office
or
your
home
,
you
know
you
're
going
to
be
around
for
a
while
.

You
're
like
,
'
Yay
,
they
're
not
going
to
write
me
out
.

With
this
(
episode
)
,
the
triumph
was
that
they
asked
me
for
some
family
pictures
.

I
brought
in
pictures
of
my
four
daughters
and
put
them
all
on
the
wall
.

(
Viewers
)
never
really
saw
them
,
but
just
in
case
one
day
they
did
and
wanted
to
reflect
back
to
that
scene
,
they
could
see
my
family
,
which
meant
(
Gus
)
could
have
a
wife
.

other
…
I
could
be
living
like
Gus
does
in
plain
sight
,
but
have
the
trimmings
of
the
whole
family
.

But
,
yes
,
for
people
to
see
the
background
of
a
character
that
you
create
and
understand
…
because
a
lot
of
our
villains
that
we
experience
,
in
many
ways
they
're
one
note
.

I
certainly
did
n't
want
to
have
Gus
be
that
.

What
truly
motivates
Gus
,
especially
going
forward
,
now
that
he
's
got
his
revenge
on
Don
Eladio
and
Tio
?

I
think
that
what
motivates
Gus
for
much
of
what
we
've
seen
has
been
revenge
,
building
his
empire
,
playing
his
cards
right
.

But
since
that
really
horrible
moment
that
we
finally
see
in
(
"
Hermanos
"
)
,
we
understand
him
a
different
way
.

It
's
not
only
revenge
,
but
the
revenge
has
played
into
taking
over
,
into
making
this
family
his
family
.

I
think
if
we
were
to
go
back
even
further
than
that
,
we
'd
see
his
connection
to
the
Pinochet
government
and
where
all
the
previous
incarnations
of
Gus
came
from
and
what
his
dream
for
his
empire
is
.

We
have
n't
seen
that
yet
,
but
I
think
the
motivation
is
a
two
-
fold
motivation
.

It
's
to
bring
people
to
their
best
selves
in
whatever
they
do
,
which
is
why
he
has
such
patience
for
Jesse
,
who
is
a
ne'er‑do‑well
drug
addict
.

And
,
I
have
to
say
,
what
moves
Gus
is
the
family
.

It
's
outlined
in
Gus
'
"
a
man
provides
"
speech
to
Walt
.

You
do
the
hard
things
that
you
have
to
do
,
some
of
them
you
will
not
want
to
do
,
to
take
care
of
your
family
.

Yeah
,
you
've
got
cancer
and
you
're
dying
.

Live
the
rest
of
your
life
and
croak
,
like
a
man
.

That
is
what
Gus
would
do
,
how
he
would
play
it
.

I
really
,
really
feel
like
that
's
his
motivation
.

He
wants
to
bring
people
to
their
best
selves
.

He
wants
to
teach
people
how
to
be
in
control
and
have
self‑control
.

He
wants
to
teach
people
how
to
be
successful
and
he
wants
to
allow
them
to
be
smart
.

Walt
has
missed
the
boat
,
in
terms
of
understanding
that
little
good
piece
of
what
Gus
is
trying
to
display
.

As
viewers
,
as
crazy
as
it
sounds
,
we
're
actually
kind
of
rooting
for
Gus
.

Despite
everything
he
's
done
,
the
box
cutter
murder
of
his
assistant
,
the
threats
to
Walt
's
whole
family
,
and
what
we
know
he
's
capable
of
…

If
that
's
the
case
,
and
I
've
been
told
that
by
others
,
then
that
means
I
've
done
my
job
really
well
.

Because
if
in
one
week
,
you
're
really
hoping
that
Jesse
takes
that
ricin
cigarette
and
puts
it
in
this
food
and
kills
Gus
,
then
in
the
very
next
episode
Gus
stands
down
the
cartel
and
you
're
like
,
"
Yeah
!
"
because
those
guys
are
worse
than
he
is
(
laughing
)

I
'm
a
thoughtful
person
,
and
I
want
to
be
challenged
.

If
you
can
go
then
,
from
one
episode
feeling
like
,
'
Oh
,
gosh
,
I
want
him
to
be
dead
,
'
and
then
in
the
next
episode
going
,
'
Wow
,
that
was
a
great
move
.

I
'm
really
glad
he
did
that
,
'
it
plays
into
my
theory
that
nothing
's
really
black
and
white
.

There
are
some
gray
areas
in
life
for
all
of
us
.
'

Breaking
Bad
'
truly
is
a
show
where
you
can
really
play
with
that
and
display
it
.

Have
the
opportunity
to
really
move
into
that
gray
area
in
a
wonderful
way
.

The
season
four
finale
airs
on
Sunday
…
have
you
looked
ahead
at
the
next
season
yet
?

Do
you
want
to
know
anything
about
it
at
this
point
?

I
do
n't
really
want
to
know
and
I
know
that
Vince
does
n't
know
.

It
's
interesting
,
because
I
've
read
what
he
's
talked
about
,
and
I
know
from
before
we
even
finished
season
four
,
people
were
asking
.

Vince
has
already
stated
,
he
told
me
two
years
ago
,
that
he
only
thought
it
was
a
five‑year
series
,
because
there
's
a
lot
to
wind
up
.

He
's
got
to
wind
up
Hank
,
finding
out
or
not
finding
out
.

He
's
got
to
wind
up
all
these
different
little
aspects
of
this
piece
.

I
think
a
good
storyteller
acknowledges
that
there
's
a
beginning
,
middle
and
end
.

I
think
it
's
going
to
be
a
discovery
for
him
,
as
it
will
be
for
us
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
know
right
now
.

I
just
want
to
bask
in
the
energy
of
this
really
pretty
incredible
fourth
season

see
what
he
comes
up
with
for
the

The

Belgium
and
Luxembourg
reached
agreement
on
Sunday
on
a
rescue
package
for
Dexia
,
which
will

to
the

Franco

bank
’s
board
later

future
of

,
”
said
a
statement
from
the
office
of
Belgium
’s
caretaker
Prime
Minister
Yves
Leterme
.

“
The
suggested
solution
,
which
is
also
the
result
of
intense
consultations
with
all
partners
involved
,
will
be
submitted
to
Dexia

BERLIN
(
Reuters
)
-
A
Greek
default
would
have
unforeseeable
consequences
and
cause
the
euro
zone
crisis
to
spread
,
European
Commission
President
Jose
Manuel
Barroso
was
quoted
as
saying
in
mass
-
selling
Bild
daily
.

Talks
are
continuing
over
a
vital
aid
tranche
for
debt
-
stricken
Athens
,
which
could
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
,
dragging
the
euro
zone
deeper
into
a
debt
crisis
already
shaking
financial
markets
worldwide
.

“
If
we
give
up
on
Greece
,
there
is
a
big
danger
that
the
crisis
will
spread
to
other
countries
,
”
Barroso
told
Bild
in
an
interview
to
be
published
on
Monday
,
echoing
comments
of
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
.

Merkel
warned
last
week
the
threat
of
contagion
from
a
euro
zone
state
rescheduling
its
debt
would
be
huge
and
only
made
sense
once
it
had
achieved
a
primary
surplus
.

Barroso
noted
the
euro
zone
had
no
experience
with
the
possible
bankruptcy
of
a
member
state
.

This
is
new
territory
for
us
and
we
are
discussing
solutions
which
have
not
really
been
tested
before
,
”
he
said
.

But
the
European
Union
was
convinced
that
a
Greek
bankruptcy
was
“
not
cheaper
for
all
participants
than
the
current
aid
schemes
,
”
he
said
.

European
finance
ministers
are
considering
making
banks
take
bigger
losses
on
Greek
debt
—
an
issue
that
could
be
discussed
at
a
meeting
between
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
later
on
Sunday
.

It
is
still
uncertain
whether
Greece
,
which
was
hit
by
strikes
and
riots
over
austerity
measures
last
week
,
will
receive
the
next
tranche
of
aid
given
doubts
over
its
willingness
to
reform
.

“
The
reforms
must
be
faster
,
otherwise
Greece
will
lose
its
credibility
,
”
said
Barroso
.

Barroso
added
that
Europe
needed
to
correct
the
“
orgy
of
consumption
”
that
had
taken
place
in
some
countries
due
to
the
introduction
of
a
strong
common
currency
with
low
interest
rates
.

Merkel
meets
with
Sarkozy
on
Sunday
to
thrash
out
differences
over
how
to
use
the
euro
zone
’s
financial
firepower
to
counter
the
debt
crisis
,
which
is
threatening
to
spiral
into
financial
meltdown
as
the
value
of
banks’
sovereign
debt
holdings
slide

days
of
talks
with
Sudan
’s
President
Omar
Hassan
al
-
Bashir
to
ease
tensions
that
have
grown
since
South
Sudan
became
independent
in
July
as
part
of
a
peace
agreement
in
2005
.

A
diplomat
said
the
talks
were
a
positive
sign
that
both
sides
wanted
to
improve
ties
but
more
time
was
needed
to
sort
out
their
complicated
disputes
.

At
a
joint
news
conference
both
leaders
said
more
negotiations
would
be
held
.

“
My
government
is
ready
to
discuss
solutions
for
all
pending
issues
,
”
Kiir
said
before
leaving
Khartoum
.

I
return
today
to
Juba
to
ensure
that
we
reach
solutions
to
all
pending
issues
.

Lets
sign
an
agreement
as
soon
as
possible
.
”

Bashir
said
committees
would
work
out
solutions
for
all
disputes
in
a
set
timeframe
.

The
African
Union
and
former
South
African
President
Thabo
Mbeki
have
tried
to
mediate
but
little
has
been
resolved
.

A
lack
of
a
joint
banking
system
and
trade
agreements
is
hampering
cross
-
border
commerce
between
north
and
south
.

The
United
States
has
urged
both
sides
to
speed
up
talks
to
reach
especially
a
deal
on
how
to
divide
oil
revenues
—
the
dominant
source
of
revenue
for
both
states
.

Juba
took
most
of
the
oil
but
need
to
pay
a
fee
to
use
northern
export
facilities
both
sides
have
failed
to
agree
upon
.

Iran
confirmed
on
Sunday
that
Gazprom
would
not
be
involved
in
the
development
of
a
major
on
-
shore
oil
field
,
accusing
the
Russian
state
energy
giant
of
dragging
its
feet
over
the
project
,
the
semi
-
official
Fars
news
agency
reported
.

Iran
—
under
international
sanctions
that
have
hit
foreign
investment
in
its
vital
energy
sector

Gazprom
from
the
Azar
field
,
but
the
two
sides
agreed
to
delay
a
final
decision
for
another
month
.

Unfortunately
,
the
Russian
Gazprom
company
has
failed
concerning
its
commitments
to
Iran
despite
the
National
Iranian
Oil
Co.
’s
(
NIOC
)
repeated
warnings
which
have
been
completely
ignored
,
”
said
NIOC
chief
Ahmad
Qalebani
.

The
Russian
company
had
not
actually
signed
a
contract
to
develop
the
field
,
on
the
border
with
Iraq
where
it
is
known
as
Badrah
,
but
Iranian
media
have
reported
since
March
2010
that
it
was
about
to
do
so
.

Iran
’s
Oil
Minister
Rostam
Qasemi
has
said
the
country
has
no
need
for
foreign
investment
in
the
energy
sector

and
that
Iranian
companies
can
do
the
work
and
find
the
finance
themselves
—
an
assertion
many
foreign
analysts
view
with
scepticism
.

After
consideration
of
the
facts
,
it
was
decided
that
we
terminate
our
cooperation
with
this
company
and
cede
the
job
to
domestic
contractors
,
”
Qalebani
said
about
Azar

British
grocer
J

said
on
Sunday
it
would
match
the
prices
of
branded
products
with
its
larger
rivals
Tesco
and
Walmart
-
owned

Asda
as
the
battle
for
price
-
conscious
customers
escalates
.

Sainsbury
said
it
would
automatically
compare
some
13,000
branded
products
with
Tesco
and
Asda
at
the
checkout
,
and
customers
would
receive
a
voucher
redeemable
on
their
next
shop
for
the
difference
if
Sainsbury
were
more
expensive
.

The
scheme
,
which
has
been
trialled
in
its
12
stores
in
Northern
Ireland
,
will
launch
on
Wednesday
.

“
Unlike
some
of
our
competitors
we
are
n’t
asking
customers
to
do
the
hard
work
to
check
on
our
prices
,
”
said
Group
Commercial
Director
Mike

,
in
a
swipe
at

promotions

“
We
are
so
confident
that
our
prices
are
competitive
with
Asda
and
Tesco
that
we
are
happy
to
do
the
legwork
for
our
customers
.

Competition
amongst
supermarkets
is
intensifying
as
households
cut
food
budgets
,
traditionally
seen
as
the
most
resilient
area
of
spending
.

Tesco
posted
one
of
its
biggest
ever
falls
in
underlying
sales
on
Wednesday
,
while
Sainsbury
reported
only
modest
growth
.

Asda
said
in
August
that
its
online
price
guarantee
,
which
undercuts
rivals
by
10
percent
,
had
helped
sales
growth
accelerate
in
the
second
quarter
.

Tesco
,
the
UK
’s
biggest
retailer
,
also
offers
an
online
price
check
,
although
only
against
Asda
.

It
has
also
cut
prices
on
more
than
3,000
staple
products
in
order
to
stem
market
share
losses

JERUSALEM
,
Oct

(
Reuters
)
-
Israel
announced
on
Sunday
it
was
seeking
an
investor
to
help
build
a
fiber
optic
network
that
would
bring
ultra
high
-
speed
internet
to
the
entire
country
and
increase
competition
in
the
telecommunications
market
.

The
nationwide
project
will
be
one
of
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
world
and
will
spur
economic
growth
,
Finance
Minister
Yuval
Steinitz
said
at
a
news
conference
.

The
project
we
are
launching
today
will
allow
growth
potential
to
be
realised
across
the
country
,
while
increasing
competition
in
the
field
of
communications
and
significantly
improving
consumer
service
,
”
he
said
.

The
new
investor
will
partner
with
state
-
run
Israel
Electric
Corp
(
IEC
)
to
form
a
private
company
that
will
build
and
operate
the
network
using
the
utility
’s
infrastructure
.

It
will
have
a
51
percent
stake
in
the
new
company
to
be
formed
by
April
2012
.

IEC
’s
Tzvi
Harpak
,
who
heads
the
tender
committee
,
said
the
project
will
cost
billions
of
shekels
and
will
include
some
25,000
km
of
optic
fibers
that
will
provide
internet
access
at
100
megabits
per
second
.

About
65
percent
of
the
country
will
be
covered
in
the
first
seven
years
and
the
rest
by
2020
,
he
said
.

Israel
’s
telecom
sector
has
a
relatively
small
amount
of
players
and
the
government
is
under
increasing
pressure
to
add
competition
and
lower
prices
.

Communication
Minister
Moshe
Kahlon
has
already
taken
aim
at
the
cellular
phone
market
in
the
past
year
by
awarding
licences
to
two
new
operators
and
allowing
the
entry
of
mobile
virtual
network
operators
.

Kahlon
said
on
Sunday
the
telecom
infrastructure
field
“
is
in
need
of
a
new
player
”
.

Currently
only
two
companies
run
internet
infrastructures
—
telephone
operator
Bezeq
and
cable
company
HOT

.

Yiftah
Ron
-
Tal
,
chairman
of
the
board
at
IEC
,
said
the
fiber
optic
project
will
bring
in
new
revenues
at
a
time
when
his
company
is
in
“
a
very
tough
financial
situation
”
.

The
IEC
has
run
into
financial
difficulties
due
to
extra
costs
for
fuel
stemming
from
a
halt
in
natural
gas
from
Egypt
,
forcing
the
company
to
turn
to
more
expensive
alternatives
.

High

ranking
officials
of
South
Africa
’s
ruling
ANC
visited
China
this
week
,
local
media
reported
on
Sunday
,
in
what
could
be
seen
as
the
party
’s
unreserved
support
for
Beijing
.

African
National
Congress
(
ANC
)
officials
were
not
immediately
available
to
confirm
reports
in
two
newspapers
—
the
City
Press
and
Sunday
Independent
—
that
party
representatives
went
to
China
.

The
visit
came
after
South
Africa
delayed
a
visa
application
for
the
Dalai
Lama
,
who
was
to
visit
the
country
to
celebrate
Nobel
Peace
Prize
winner
Desmond
Tutu
’s
birthday
.

ANC
supporters
,
leading
newspapers
and
Tutu
said
the
move
was
symbolic
of
the
failings
of
the
party
that
helped
end
apartheid
but
was
now
failing
to
live
up
to
the
ideals
of
the
liberation
movement
it
had
once
been
.

China
has
labelled
the
Dalai
Lama
a
dangerous
separatist
and
analysts
said
Pretoria
bowed
to
pressure
from
its
largest
trading
partner
to
bar
the
Tibetan
spiritual
leader
from
visiting
,
damaging
its
reputation
in
the
process
.

Two
weeks
ago
,
China
pledged
to
invest
$
2.5
billion
in
South
Africa
during
a
visit
to
Beijing
by
Deputy
President
Kgalema
Motlanthe
.

The
City

said
ANC
Secretary

General
Gwede
Mantashe
,
high
-
ranking
official
Jessie
Duarte
,
deputy
economic
development
minister
Enoch
Godongwana
and
other

officials
had
spent
the
week
in
China
on
an
exchange
programme
with
the
Chinese
Communist
Party
.

Paul
Mashatile
was
quoted
in
the
City
Press
as
saying
the
Chinese
governing
party
had
offered
to
“
teach
the
ANC
about
politics
”
.

In
a
video
link
with
Cape

the
Dalai
Lama
on
Saturday
said
China

were
hypocrites
whose

on
lies

a

Oil
production
at

Rumaila
oilfield
had
been
cut
by
700,000
barrels
per
day
from
about
1.24

on
Friday
halted
some
of

BP

,
said
on
Saturday
it
had
to
stop
some
of

from
the
Rumaila
oilfield
after
SOC
requested
it
.

Rumaila
,
the

battle
with
cancer
—-
a
fight
that
robbed
him
of
the
ability
to
speak
,
eat
and
drink
,
while
leaving
him
,
in
his
own
words
,
looking
like
“
the
Phantom
of
the
Opera
.
”

There
are
also
odes
to
the
Chicago

based
fast
food
chain
Steak

N
Shake
,
loving
accounts
of
travel
to
foreign
cities
such
as
London
and
Venice
,
riffs
on
secular
humanism
,
and
a
chronicle
of
lost
virginity
involving
a
prostitute
in
South
Africa
.

Even
boyhood
dog
Blackie
gets
a
chapter
.

At
the
end
of
it
,
you
’ll
know
more
about
Ebert
than
you
do
your
closest
friends
,
and
that
’s
not
always
a
good
thing
.

Though
the
prose
is
crisp
and
the
stories
,
like
Ebert
’s
best
reviews
,
glide
effortlessly
without
ever
calling
attention
to
the
writing
,
it
’s
hard
to
shake
the
feeling
that
some
of
what
’s
recounted
could
have
benefited
from
the
red
pen
and
that
the
most
interesting
bits
were
left
on
the
cutting
-
room
floor
.

"
Life
Itself
"
is
generous
,
witty
,
and
warm
-
hearted
,
but
it
’s
also
a
bit
rudderless
.

Ebert
’s
unflinching
account
of
his
struggles
with
alcoholism
is
admirable
,
as
is
his
dignity
in
coping
with
the
surgeries
that
mangled
his
face
and
robbed
him
of
his
voice
,
but
the
book
takes
off
when
he
describes
his
career
critiquing
movies
.

The
emotional
highpoint
is
not
when
he
finally
gives
up
the
bottle
or
accepts
his
medical
condition
,
but
in
his
loving
tribute
to
Gene
Siskel
,
his
co
-
anchor
on
a
weekly
review
series
“
Siskel
&
Ebert
:

The
tall
,
relatively
slender
,
and
private
Siskel
,
who
died
of
a
brain
tumor
in
1999
,
was
the
physical
and
temperamental
opposite
of
the
squat
,
portly
,
and
effusive
Ebert
.

Yet
the
two
shared
an
improbable
on
-
screen
chemistry
that
worked
off
-
screen
,
too
.

Part
of
the
fun
of
their
pairing
were
the
moments
when
the
two
parted
ways
on
a
movie
and
would
engage
in
full
-
throated
debates
about
a
film
’s
merits
.

That
combativeness
,
Ebert
writes
,
almost
inspired
a
sitcom
about
two
rival
critics
joined
in
a
love
/
hate
relationship
,
but
both
CBS
and
Disney
ultimately
took
a
pass
on
the
pitch
.

Maybe
the
problem
was
that
no
one
else
could
possibly
understand
how
meaningless
was
the
hate
,
how
deep
was
the
love
,
”
Ebert
writes
.

Love
forms
the
spine
of
Ebert
’s
memoir
—
love
for
his
emotionally
crippling
mother
,
love
for
his
former
bar
-
mates
and
fellow
newspaper
hounds
,
and
love
for
Chaz
,
the
woman
who
has
been
a
guardian
angel
,
fiercely
protective
of
his
business
interests
and
his
medical
care
.

It
also
appears
,
in
an
all
-
too
-
brief
account
of
what
films
excite
Ebert
,
in
which
he
recounts
what
makes
a
memorable
film
.

He
does
n’t
have
a
precise
formula
,
mixing
in
everything
from
the
joyful
physical
movement
that
defines

“
Singing
in
the
Rain
”
to
the
great
dialogue
that
bubbles
up
during
the
first
30
minutes
of
“
White
Men

but

it
seems
to
boil
down
to
you
know
it
when
you
see
it
.

“
When
you
go
to
the
movies
every
day
,
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
the
movies
are
more
mediocre
than
ever
,
more
craven
and
cowardly
,
more
skillfully
manufactured
to
pander
to
the
lowest
tastes
instead
of
educating
them
,
”
Ebert
writes
.

Then
you
see
something
absolutely
miraculous
,
and
on
your
way
out
you
look
distracted
,
as
if
you
had
just
experienced
some
kind
of
a
vision
.

Top

denied
a

that
they
could

11
billion

(
$
14.8
billion
)
as

Le

had
reported
that

by

would
seek
about

denied
the

reiterating
that
it

to

capital
targets
without
a

increase

SocGen
also
denied
the
report
and
also
said
it

The

said
most
European

groups
would
prefer
a
European
recapitalisation
mechanism
“
so
as
not
to

stigmatized
,
”
adding
that
the
European

Authority
could
be
in

of
such
a
plan
.

A
French

source
told
Reuters
on
Friday
there
was
common
agreement
between
Paris
and
Berlin
on
the
need
to
recapitalise
European
banks
,
adding
that
injections
of
public
capital
would
be
a
“
last
resort

BERLIN
(

-
Germans
believe
a
“
grand
coalition
”
of
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
’s
conservatives
and
the
opposition
Social

(
SPD
)
would
rule
the
country
better
than
her
current
fractious
cabinet
,
a
survey
showed
on
Sunday
.

Some
41
percent
of
Germans
believe
such
a
coalition
would
be
best
placed
to
solve
Germany
’s
problems
,
according
to
the
Emnid
poll
published
by
mass
-

.

Just
12
percent
were
in
favor
of
the
current
coalition
of
conservatives
and
pro
-
business
Free
Democrats
(
FDP
)
.

Infighting
in
Merkel
’s
cabinet
and
a
slump
in
support
for
the
FDP
have
crimped
her
room
to
maneuver
at
a
crucial
point
in
the
euro

crisis
when
leaders
worldwide
are
clamoring
for
Europe

.

Merkel
meets
with
French
President
Nicolas

on
Sunday
to
discuss
how
to
counter
the
crisis
threatening
the

Some

,
as
well
as
the
Christian
Social

,
sister
party
of

’s

Christian

(

,
have
sought
to
distance
themselves
from
her
European
policy
in
order
to
rally
support
among
bailout
-
weary
Germans
.

“
It
’s
not
surprising
that
Germans’
desire
for
a
grand

is
growing
given
that
this
stands
for
a
strong

at

a

,

in

.

There
is

Merkel
’s
CDU
is
working
on
its
vision
for
Europe
,
Spiegel
magazine
wrote
,
quoting
a
draft
of
a
policy
paper
for
the
party
’s
November
conference
.

According
to
this
draft
,
the
CDU
wants
more
Europe
,
namely
a
“
completion
of
the
currency
union
”
through
greater
economic
integration
.

The
euro
zone
should
also
have
a
restructuring
procedure
for
members
that
are
unable
to
fulfill
the
conditions
for
a
stable
common
currency
despite
increased
incentives
.

One
further
CDU
proposal
is
for
big
countries
like
Germany
to
have
a
greater
influence
in
the
European
Central
Bank
,
according
to
Spiegel
.

Two
German
ECB
policymakers
quit
the
ECB
this
year
in
apparent
protest
at
the
its
bond

buying
program

It
is
unclear
however
which
proposals
will
remain
in
the
final
draft
,
which
the
working
group
is
set
to
agree
on
Wednesday
,
and
the
CDU
leadership
toward
the
end
of
October
.

Meanwhile
,
the
CSU
and
FDP
are
discussing
their
European
strategies
separately
and
taking
a
tougher
stance
on
bailout
aid
,
making
it
difficult
for
Merkel
to
push
through
her
ideas
.

Support
for
the
FDP
slumped
to
3
percent
,
according
to
a
separate
Emnid
poll
published
on
Sunday
,
while
the
conservatives
were
steady
at
32
percent
,
giving
them
a
combined
35
percent
.

Support
for
the
SPD
and
Greens
was
stable
at
28
and
17
percent
respectively
,
giving
them
a
total
of
45

.

The
winners
were
once
again
the
upstart
Pirate
Party
,
who
gained
two
percentage
points
to
9
percent
,
meaning
they
could
board
parliament
in
the
next
federal
elections
and
suggesting
a
frustration
with
main
-
stream
parties

The
Pirates
are
a
German
branch
of
the
party
that
emerged
five
years
ago
in
Sweden
to
campaign
for
freer
Internet
usage
.

Since
broadening
their
agenda
to
issues
such
as
more
direct
democracy
and
establishing
a
minimum
wage
,
they
have
struck
a
chord
with
voters
in
Germany
.

FDP
leaders
at
the
weekend
conceded
they
could
learn
from
the
Pirates
,
who
were
long
dismissed
as
too
kooky
to
take
seriously
but
plundered
the
FDP
’s
voters
in
a
recent
regional
election
in
Berlin
where
they
took
9
percent
of
the
vote
.

Irish
house
prices
are
getting
close
to
a
sustainable
level
where
purchasers
will
be
confident
enough
to
re
-
enter
the
market
following
a
property
crash
,
Ireland
’s
central
bank
governor
was
quoted
as
saying
on
Sunday
.

Aided
by
years
of
reckless
lending
,
Irish
property
prices
rocketed
to
unsustainable
levels
during
the
go
-
go
period
of
the

“
Celtic
Tiger
”
economy
,
but
a
spectacular
bursting
of
a
property
bubble
has
seen
prices
tumble
for
almost
four
years
.

Residential
house
prices
have
fallen
by
an
average
of
43
percent
from
their
2007
peak
,
according
to
the
Central
Statistics
Office
,
and
Patrick
Honohan
said
they
were
now
edging
towards
a
sustainable
level
.

“
Banks
will
lend
when
both
they
and
the
borrowers
and
the
purchasers
of
houses
are
confident
that
they
’re
getting
the
house
at
a
fair
,
sustainable
price

and
I
think
we
’re
getting
close
to
that
point
,
”
the
Sunday
Independent
quoted
Honohan
as
saying
,
citing
comments
in
a
documentary
to
be
aired
on
Monday
.

Under
tough
bank
stress
tests
in
March
,
the
central
bank
’s
baseline
scenario
assumed
a
55
percent
peak
to
trough
fall
in
residential
property
prices
between
2007
and
2013
,
with
its
adverse
scenario
pencilling
in
a
drop
of
62
percent

Hugh
Osmond
’s
Sun
Capital
Partners
has
pulled
out
of
the
race
to
buy
632
Lloyds
branches
,
raising
doubts
that
the
assets
will
fetch
as
much
as
the
bank
wanted
,
the
Sunday
Telegraph
reported
.

The
newspaper
said
it
understood
Sun
Capital
Partners
was
“
unlikely
”
to
enter
a
second
-
round
bid
for
the
branches
,
which
Lloyds
has
been
ordered
to
sell
by
European
regulators
after
the
bank
was
rescued
by
the
British
taxpayer
.

It
quoted
one
source
with
knowledge
of
Sun
Capital
’s
position
saying
a
bid
“
made
no
sense
at
the
moment
”
,
in
reference
to
the
current
state
of
capital
markets
.

New
British
bank
venture
NBNK
confirmed
last
month
it
had
submitted
a
second
-
round
bid
,
said
to
be
worth
1.5
billion
pounds
(
$
2.3
billion
)
,
for
the
branches
.

Co
-
operative
Financial
Services
was
also
still
in
the
running
,
it
said
last
month
,
although
it
had
not
yet
submitted
a
second
-
round
bid
.

Analysts
had
previously
said
the
branches
could
fetch
about
2.5
billion
pounds
.

The
Sunday
Telegraph
said
Osmond
could
still
re
-
enter
the
race
at
a
later
stage
,
as
could
NAB
and
Virgin
Money
.

Lloyds
declined
to
comment
on
the
report
,
while
a
spokesman
for
Osmond
was
not
immediately
available

BERLIN
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
will
thrash
out
differences
with
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
on
Sunday
over
how
to
use
the
euro
zone
’s
financial
firepower
to
counter
a
sovereign
debt
crisis
threatening
the
global
economy
.

With
the
turmoil
threatening
to
spiral
into
financial
meltdown
as
the
value
of
banks’
sovereign
bond
holdings
slide
,
Merkel
and
Sarkozy
are
likely
to
discuss
in
Berlin
both
how
to
manage
Greece
,
prevent
contagion
and
strengthen
lenders
.

The
implosion
of
Belgian
lender
Dexia
,
the
first
victim
of
the
crisis
,
has
added
a
sense
of
urgency
to
the
talks
.

The
prime
ministers
of
France
and
Belgium
and
the
finance
minister
of
Luxembourg
agreed
a
rescue
plan
for
Dexia
on
Sunday
ahead
of
the
stricken
Franco
-
Belgian
bank
.

“
Dexia
will
be
among
the
topics
that
will
be
discussed
but
the
main
topic
is
Greece
and
the
euro
zone
,
as
banks
are
only
a
consequence
”
of
the
crisis
,
a
source
at
the
French
finance
ministry
told
Reuters
.

Sarkozy
is
due
to
arrive
in
Berlin
late
on
Sunday
afternoon
and
hold
a
meeting
with
Merkel
followed
by
a
working
dinner
.

A
news
conference
will
take
place
at
1530
GMT
.

Talks
are
continuing
over
a
vital
aid
tranche
for
Greece
,
which
could
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
.

European
finance
ministers
are
considering
making
banks
take
bigger
losses
on
Greek
debt
—
an
issue
that
could
be
discussed
at
the
Merkel
-
Sarkozy
meeting
.

“
It
is
possible
that
we
assumed
in
July
a
level
of
debt
reduction
that
was
too
low
,
”
German
Finance
Minister
Wolfgang
Schaeuble
was
cited
as
saying
by
a
newspaper
on
Sunday
.

Separately
,
European
Commission
head
Jose
Manuel
Barroso
told
Bild
a
Greek
default
would
have
unforeseeable
consequences
and
may
cause
the
crisis
to
spread
.

This
is
new
territory
for
us
and
we
are
discussing
solutions
which
have
not
really
been
tested
before
,
”
he
said
.

Germany
and
France
have
so
far
been
split
over
how
to
recapitalise
Europe
’s
banks
,
which
Ireland
estimated
on
Saturday
may
need
more
than
100
billion
euros
(
$
135
billion
)
to
withstand
the
sovereign
debt
crisis
,
while
the
International
Monetary
Fund
(
IMF
)
has
said
the
banks
need
200
billion
in
additional
funds
.

Paris
wants
to
tap
the
euro
zone
’s
440
billion
European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)
to
recapitalise
its
own
banks
,
while
Berlin
is
insisting
the
fund
should
be
used
as
a
last
resort
.

Qatar
is
being
cited
by
some
media
as
a
potential
saviour
for
European
banks
yet
analysts
believe
tiny
Gulf
Arab
state
is
an
unlikely
white
knight
,
as
Europe
’s
needs
are
too
great
.

Top
French
banks
BNP
Paribas
and
Societe
Generale

denied
a
report
on
Sunday
that
they
could
seek
to
raise
a
combined
11
billion
euros
as
part
of
a
broader
European
bank
recapitalisation
plan
.

Another
key
dispute
is
how
to
use
the
EFSF
to
buy
sovereign
debt
to
prevent
contagion
of
the
crisis
,
particularly
crucial
if
Greece
fails
to
secure
its
next
aid
tranche
.

France
does
not
want
to
set
guidelines
for
the
EFSF
on
the
matter
,
whereas
Germany
wants
to
limit
the
sum
used
for
each
member
state
and
set
a
time
limit
for
bond
purchasing
.

“
Given
that
the
EFSF
is
limited
overall
,
it
makes
sense
also
to
limit
the
purchases
on
the
secondary
market
for
each
country
,
”
Michael
Meister
,
deputy
parliamentary
leader
of
Merkel
’s
conservatives
,
told
Reuters
.

There
was
a
danger
,
otherwise
,
the
funds
could
be
quickly
used
up
,
he
said
.

Berlin
could
be
prepared
to
allow
a
more
flexible
use
of
the
EFSF
to
prop
up
states
and
banks
if
Paris
agrees
to
a
broad
haircut
on
Greek
debt
,
a
German
paper
wrote
on
Sunday
.

But
a
government
source
told
Reuters
:
“
There
is
no
such
agreement
”
.

Furthermore
,
Merkel
warned
last
Tuesday
that
the
threat
of
contagion
from
a
euro
zone
country
rescheduling
its
debt
would
be
huge
,
and
it
only
made
sense
once
it
had
achieved
a
primary
surplus
again
.

The
two
euro
zone
heavyweights
have
come
under
pressure
worldwide
to
resolve
Europe
’s
crisis
which
is
roiling
markets
.

U.S.
President
Barack
Obama
on
Thursday
urged
Europe
to
“
act
fast
”
,
calling
the
common
currency
bloc
’s
crisis
the
largest
obstacle
to
the
United
States’
own
recovery
.

World
Bank
President
Robert
Zoellick
told
Wirtschaftswoche
magazine
there
was
a
“
total
lack
”
of
vision
in
Europe
and
Germany
in
particular
needed
to
show
more
leadership
.

Merkel
will
visit
Vietnam
and
Mongolia
this
coming
week
.

Hurricane
Jova
,
a
category
1
storm
off
Mexico
’s
Pacific
coast
,
strengthened
on
Sunday
,
with
top
winds
reaching
90
miles
per
hour
(
150
kph
)
.

Jova
was
about
350
miles
(
560
km
)
west
-
southwest
of
the
port
city
of
Manzanillo
,
the
Miami
-
based
National
Hurricane
Center
said
.

No
coastal
watches
or
warnings
were
in
effect
but
the
center
warned
that
a
hurricane
watch
would
likely
be
required
for
parts
of
southwest
Mexico
later
on
Sunday
.

Jova
could
become
a
major
hurricane
by
Monday
night
or
Tuesday
,
the
center
said
.

It
is
expected
to
reach
land
early
next
week
.

Mexico
has
no
oil
installations
in
the
Pacific
but
Jova
is
headed
to
a
part
of
the
coast
that
is
popular
with
tourists
.

All
Mexico
’s
major
ports
were
open
.

YAOUNDE
(
Reuters
)
-
Voters
in
Cameroon
faced
delays
and
organizational
snags
in
an
election
on
Sunday
where
President
Paul
Biya
is
expected
to
extend
his
29-year
rule
over
the
central
African
state
against
a
fragmented
opposition
.

The
one
-
round
vote
comes
just
weeks
after
a
smooth
handover
of
power
in
Zambia
showed
that
Africa
can
deliver
peaceful
political
change
through
the
ballot
box
.

But
with
Biya
,
78
,
seen
keeping
his
place
among
the
clutch
of
African
leaders
in
power
for
decades
,
the
main
question
in
the
oil
-
producing
nation
is
whether
the
election
will
pass
smoothly
after
rivals
alleged
the
vote
is
skewed
against
them
.

Election
observers
said
early
voting
had
begun
peacefully
but
cited
delays
at
some
polling
stations
and
irregularities
,
such
as
some
voters
being
allowed
to
jump
the
queue
.

“
We
’re
a
bit
concerned
,
there
seems
to
be
separate
treatment
for
VIP
voters
,
”
Commonwealth
observer
mission
leader
Frederick
Mitchell
,
the
Bahamas’
ex
-
foreign
minister
,
said
by
telephone
.

Samuel
Enyegue
,
a
resident
of
the
capital
Yaounde
,
was
one
of
a
number
of
voters
interviewed
by
Reuters
who
said
he
had
been
unable
to
cast
his
vote
.

This
is
pure
rubbish
,
”
said
Enyegue
outside
a
polling
station
in
the
Biyem
-
Assi
district
.

I
can
not
understand
why
I
registered
but
my
name
is
not
on
the
(
voters’
)
list
.
”

Biya
’s
main
rival
John
Fru
Ndi
of
the
Social
Democratic
Front
(
SDF
)
said
a
surplus
of
voting
slips
meant
some
had
voted
twice
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
and
said
election
body
Elecam
would
be
blamed
for
the
“
disorder
and
confusion
.

Casting
his
vote
in
Yaounde
,
Biya
asked
for
patience
.

“
It
(
Elecam
)
is
a
young
organization
...

I
’m
just
asking
that
there
should
be
indulgence
in
any
eventual
imperfection
.

There
was
no
intention
to
fraud
,
”
he
said
.

Aside
from
its
oil
,
Cameroon
is
the
region
’s
main
maritime
entry
point
and
breadbasket
,
supplying
Chad
,
Central
African
Republic
,
Congo
Republic
and
Gabon
.

It
hosts
the
Chad
-
Cameroon
pipeline
and
shelters
refugees
from
the
region
’s
conflicts
.

Biya
faces
22
candidates
including
Fru
Ndi
,
and
Adamou
Ndam
Njoya
of
the
Cameroon
Democratic
Union
(
UDC
)
.

In
the
last
election
in
2004
,
Biya
scored
just
over
70
percent
,
while
his
closest
rival
,
Fru
Ndi
,
took
17
percent
.

In
2008
a
move
by
Biya
to
scrap
term
limits
,
and
anger
over
food
prices
,
led
to
street
protests
in
which
more
than
100
people
died
,
but
for
most
of
the
past
three
decades
there
has
seen
relative
stability
in
a
turbulent
region
.

However
,
one
issue
which
has
not
gone
away
is
a
separatist
movement
in
the
south
and
last
week
security
forces
detained
more
than
200
people
after
they
held
a
banned
rally
calling
for
the
right
to
secede
.

Biya
’s
goal
is
to
set
Cameroon
on
the
path
to
being
an
emerging
nation
such
as
Mexico
and
Malaysia
by
2035
.

Yet
Cameroon
’s
media
and
opposition
have
criticized
Biya
for
lax
governance
,
allowing
corruption
,
red
tape
and
nepotism
to
fester
.

Average
income
per
head
stands
at
an
annual
$
2,000
—
higher
than
most
of
the
region
—
but
the
IMF
has
described
its
forecast
3.8
percent
growth
this
year
as
below
potential
.

Some
observers
speculate
that
Biya
,
if
reelected
,
will
use
his
new
term
to
arrange
a
handover
of
power
to
an
anointed
successor
.

But
his
domination
of
the
local
political
scene
means
there
is
currently
no

BEIJING
(

-
Alberto
Contador
will
be
enough
of
a
weapon
against
the
might
of
the
new
RadioShack
-
Nissan
cycling
team
next
year
,
the
Spaniard
’s
Saxo
Bank
team
manager
Bjarne
Riis
said
on
Sunday
.

American
Johan
Bruyneel
,
who
guided
Lance
Armstrong
to
his
record
seven
Tour
de
France
titles
,
will
be
at
the
helm
of
RadioShack
-
Nissan
,
the
result
of
the
merger
between
RadioShack
and
Leopard
-
Trek
.

Twice
Tour
runner
-
up
Andy
Schleck
is
set
to
be
the
leader
of
an
outfit
also
likely
to
feature
Andreas
Kloeden
and
time
-
trial
and
one
-
day
race
specialist
Fabian
Cancellara
.

Maybe
Johan
Bruyneel
will
be
leading
the
best
team
in
the
world
—
and
that
’s
not
even
sure
,
”
Dane
Riis
told
Reuters
at
the
Tour
of
Beijing
,
which
ended
on
Sunday
.

,
I
will
always
have
the
best
rider
in
the
world
and
that
’s
a
fact
.

Contador
,
however
,
is
awaiting
a
Court
of
Arbitration
for
Sport
(
CAS
)
ruling
next
month
over
a
failed
dope
test
in
the
2010
Tour
de
France
.

The
Spaniard
,
one
of
only
five
men
with
wins
in
all
three
grands
Tours
(
Giro
,
Tour
,
Vuelta
)
,
could
face
a
two
-
year
ban
if
the
CAS
,
following
an
appeal
by
the
International
Cycling
Union
(
UCI
)
and
the
World
Anti
-
Doping
Agency
(
WADA
)
,
overturn
the
Spanish
federation
’s
decision
to
clear
Contador
.

Contador
,
who
suffered
his
first
defeat
in
a
grand
Tour
since
2007
in
this
year
’s
Tour
de
France
,
would
,
at
least
,
be
stripped
of
his
2010
Tour
title
if
found
guilty
.

“
I
ca
n’t
wait
for
this
to
be
over
,
”
Riis
said
.

I
am
optimistic
although
there
is
still
the
fear
that
CAS
could
rule
against
him
.

I
am
waiting
but
it
is
long
,
too
long
.

It
’s
been
dragging
on
for
over
a
year
.
”

Contador
denied
any
wrongdoing
,
saying
his
failed
test
came
because
he
ate
contaminated
meat
.

Nearly
200
factories
,
including
one
run
by
Japanese
car
maker
Honda
Motor
Co
Ltd
,
closed
in
the
central
Thai
province
of
Ayutthaya
because
of
flooding
,
which
could
threaten
Bangkok
this
week
,
officials
said
on
Sunday
.

About
261
people
have
died
since
late
July
in
flood
-
related
incidents
,
the
Department
of
Disaster
Prevention
and
Mitigation
said
.

Some
2.3
million
people
have
been
affected
in
the
worst
flooding
to
hit
parts
of
Thailand
in
50
years
,
mainly
in
the
center
,
north
and
northeast
.

The
Rojana
estate
in
Ayutthaya
province
,
run
by
Rojana
Industrial
Park
Pcl
,
was
flooded
after
a
wall
of
sandbags
failed
to
hold
back
water
overnight
.

“
All
198
factories
at
Rojana
have
to
be
closed
because
the
water
is
about
5.1
meters
high
,
”
Industry
Minister
Wannarat
Channukul
told
Reuters
.

A
Honda
spokeswoman
said
it
had
moved
about
3,000
assembled
cars
from
the
estate
to
other
areas
.

Hana
Microelectronics
Pcl
has
also
had
to
close
its
plant
in
Ayutthaya
.

On
Thursday
the
Center
for
Economic
and
Business
Forecasting
,
part
of
the
University
of
the
Thai
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
cut
its
forecast
for
gross
domestic
product
(
GDP
)
growth
this
year
to
3.6
percent
from
4.4
percent
because
of
the
floods
.

It
put
the
impact
of
the
flooding
at
between
1.0
and
1.3
percentage
points
of
GDP
and
said
its
new
growth
forecast
would
have
been
lower
but
for
recent
strength
in
exports
.

The
commerce
ministry
said
on
Friday
it
had
slashed
its
forecast
for
the
main
rice
crop
,
which
farmers
are
just
starting
to
bring
in
,
to
21
million
tones
from
25
million
because
of
the
flooding
.

Thailand
is
the
world
’s
biggest
rice
exporter
.

The
crop
damage
will
add
to
the
pressure
on
export
prices
,
already
being
forced
up
by
the
high
buying
price
set
under
a
government
intervention
scheme
aimed
at
helping
poor
farmers
.

Bangkok
Governor
Sukhumbhand
Paribatra
said
in
a
statement
the
authorities
were
preparing
an
evacuation
plan
to
move
people
from
affected
areas
if
floods
hit
the
capital
,
much
of
which
is
just
two
meters
above
sea
level
.

Some
riverside
areas
have
already
suffered
minor
flooding
but
the
level
of
the
Chao
Phraya
River
could
rise
sharply
from
October
15
-
18
when
a
large
amount
of
water
will
reach
the
area
from
the
north
,
where
dams
are
close
to
overflowing
,
at
a
time
of
high
sea
tides
.

The
government
was
trying
to
accelerate
the
drainage
of
water
from
the
Chao
Phraya
into
the
sea
before
the
high
tide
.

Other
Southeast
Asian
countries
have
suffered
serious
flooding
in
recent
weeks
because
of
heavy
monsoon
rains
combined
with
tropical
storms
.

The
death
toll
from
two
strong
typhoons
that
cut
across
the
north
of
the
Philippines’
main
island
and
left
behind
widespread
flooding
had
risen
to
101
as
of
Sunday
,
the
national
disaster
agency
said
.

At
least
167
people
had
died
in
Cambodia
by
late
last
week
and
15
in
Vietnam
.

Beijing
issues
wealth

rules
,

Jan

*
Tells
banks
not
to
use
wealth
products
to
draw
deposits

BEIJING
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
China
has
signed
off
a
set
of
rules
for
its
small
but
booming
wealth
management
sector
to
temper
rapid
growth
and
prevent
banks
from
exploiting
loopholes
to
beat
regulation
.

More
than
just
an
area
of
growth
,
China
’s
wealth
industry
has
been
used
by
banks
to
attract
deposits
and
skirt
lending
restrictions
,
much
to
the
chagrin
of
Beijing
which
wants
to
control
lending
to
manage
inflation
.

The
new
rules
would
,
among
other
things
,
prohibit
banks
from
using
wealth
products
to
attract
deposits
or
from
luring
customers
into
buying
products
that
do
not
conform
with
their
risk
appetites
.

In
a
21-page
,
80-clause
document
released
by
the
China
Banking
Regulatory
Commission
on
Sunday
,
Beijing
stressed
that
banks
must
toe
the
line
or
be
punished
.

The
rules
are
effective
from
January
1
,
2012
.

In
recent
years
,
the
wealth
management
business
in
commercial
banks
has
grown
rapidly
,
”
the
regulator
said
,
noting
that
banks
have
grown
more
creative
in
the
way
they
design
,
sell
and
manage
wealth
products
.

But
at
the
same
time
,
the
growth
has
exposed
problems
and
weaknesses
,
”
it
said
.

There
have
even
been
instances
of
misguided
or
misleading
sales
,
harming
consumers’
interests
and
banks’
reputations
.

In
China
,
Beijing
tells
banks
how
much
to
lend
and
at
what
price
by
setting
loan
quotas
and
limits
on
deposit
and
lending
rates
.

This
has
fed
stiff
competition
between
banks
when
it
comes
to
courting
savers
,
leading
them
to
sell
wealth
products
with
yields
well
above
benchmark
deposit
rates
to
attract
deposits
and
support
loan
growth
.

China
’s
wealth
industry
has
grown
at
an
average
rate
of
45
percent
in
the
past
three
years
,
Liu
Mingkang
,
head
of
the
bank
regulator
,
said
earlier
this
year
.

He
said
the
sector
managed
1.7
trillion
yuan
(
$
266
billion
)
as
of
the
end
of
2010
.

Below
are
some
of
rules
outlined
by
the
regulator
:

—
Banks
can
not
use
wealth
products
to
attract
deposits
or
bundle
products
in
other
promotions

—
Banks
can
not
lure
deposits
by
raising
interest
rates
in
“
disguised
”
forms

—
Promotions
can
not
be
aired
on
television
;
they
must
be
fair
and
open
,
and
explain
potential
risks
in
simple
language
to
protect
interests
of
customers
who
can
not
be
misled

—
Promotions
should
have
this
phrase
in
a
prominent
spot
:
Wealth
management
is
not
a
form
of
savings
;
products
have
risks
;
invest
carefully
.

—
Banks
can
not
trick
customers
into
buying
products
that
do
not
conform
with
their
risk
appetites

—
Sales
tactics
such
as
price
discounts
and
free
gifts
are
not
allowed

—
Banks
can
not
promise
investment
returns
or
vow
to
undertake
losses
when
selling
products

—
Customers
must
be
informed
of
any
changes
in
investment
strategies
that
may
swing
returns

—
Clients
have
the
right
to
redeem
investments
if
they
do
not
accept
proposed
investment
changes

—
Sales
staff
should
be
judged
by
how
well
they
sell
and
the
number
of
customer
complaints
they
get

—
Banks
must
tell
Beijing
who
their
target
clients
are
;
where
their
wealth
businesses
are
and
they
are
run

JERUSALEM

(

-
East
Mediterranean
Gas
(
EMG
)
has
filed
a
request
for
international
arbitration
in
the
wake
of
a
series
of
gas
disruptions
from
Egypt
,
an
EMG
stakeholder
said
on
Sunday
.

Ampal
-
American
Israel
Corp
,
which
owns
12.5
percent
of
East
Mediterranean
Gas
(
EMG
)
,
said
EMG
seeks
to
begin
arbitration
hearings
against
Egyptian
General
Petroleum
Corp
and
Egyptian
Natural
Gas
Holding
Co
(
EGAS
)
through
the
International
Chamber
of
Commerce
.

EMG
is
seeking
compensation
from
Egypt
for
damages
resulting
from
contractual
breaches
,
Ampal
said
in
a
statement
to
the
Tel
Aviv
Stock
Exchange
.

“
Ampal
,
as
well
as
other
international
shareholders
,
are
determined
to
pursue
every
available
avenue
to
secure
the
smooth
operation
of
EMG
,
”
said
Yosef
Maiman
,
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
of
Ampal
.

In
July
,
an
EMG
board
member
told
Reuters
that
shareholders
in
the
company
were
seeking
$
8
billion
in
damages
to
EMG
and
its
clients
from
contract
violations
in
gas
supplies
.

“
EMG
is
pursuing
all
legal
options
whether
it
’s
by
shareholders
or
by
the
company
,

”
a
source
close
to
EMG
told
Reuters
.

Israel
relies
on
Egypt
for
more
than
40
percent
of
gas
needs
to
Israel
’s
electric
utility
but
supplies
have
been
cut
off
a
number
of
times
this
year
due
to
attacks
on
the
pipeline
—
run
by
EGAS
—
that
also
supplies
gas
to
Jordan
.

The
attacks
are
believed
to
be
from
militants
opposed
to
selling
Egyptian
gas
to
Israel
.

EMG
is
also
12.5
percent
owned
by
Merhav
which
is
held
by
Maiman
while
other
stakeholders
in
EMG
include
Egyptian
businessman
Hussain
Salem
,
Egypt
Natural
Gas
Co
,
Thailand
’s

PTT

and
U.S.
businessman
Sam
Zell
.

“
Ampal
,
as
well
as
other
international
investors
,
have
invested
a
substantial
amount
of
money
in
EMG
through
direct
investments
and
in
EMG
’s
shares
,
”
Maiman
said
.

Egypt
’s
new
government
has
also
been
trying
to
amend
its
contracts
with
Israel
and
Jordan
following
complaints
that
prices
fixed
during
former
President
Hosni
Mubarak
’s
rule
were
below
market
rates
.

We
hope
that
the
government
of
Egypt
and
the
Egyptian
state
-
controlled
gas
supplier
elect
to
honor
the
obligations
under
the
gas
sale
and
purchase
agreement
,
”
Maiman
said
.

However
,
we
will
continue
to
take
all
necessary
actions
to
protect
our
investments
.

The
gas
disruptions
have
already
caused
financial
harm
to
state

which
has
had
to
switch

LONDON

Oct

-
Commodities
trading
giant
Glencore

could
come
to
the
aid
of
Indonesia
’s
Bakrie
family
over
the
financing
of
a
loan
backed
by
a
stake
in
London
-
listed
Bumi

,
the
Sunday
Telegraph
reported
.

A
holding
company
for
the
Bakries
,
one
of
Indonesia
’s
most
politically
connected
families
,
said
last
week
it
was
looking
to
restructure
or
repay
a
$
597
million
loan
,
part
of
$
1.35
billion
leant
by
Credit
Suisse
in
March
.

Bankers
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
Bakrie
Group

would
not
let
go
its
control
over
Bumi
,
an
Indonesian
mining
company
created
by
Nat
Rothschild
in
which
it
holds
a
54.6
percent
stake
,
despite
the
loan
issue
.

The
Sunday

said
,
without

,
that
Glencore
was
looking
at
providing
some
sort
of
“
quasi
-
debt
facility
”
to
support
the
family
but
was
understood
not
to
be

.

Analysts
at
Liberum
said
last
week
that
although
they
had
no
detailed
knowledge
of
the
loan
agreement
,
Glencore
would
be
an
obvious
buyer
of
any
Bakrie

,
given
that
it
signed
a
share
swop
agreement
with
the
Bakries
last
year
over
4.8

of

Poland
voted
in
a
parliamentary
election
on
Sunday
that
could
give
Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
’s
centre
-
right
Civic
Platform
four
more
years
in
power
to
pursue
gradual
economic
reforms
and
preserve
political
stability
.

Civic
Platform
,
which
guided
Poland
through
the
2008
-
2009
financial
crisis
and
favours
closer
ties
with
the
rest
of
the
European
Union
,
would
be
the
first
party
to
hold
on
to
power
in
an
election
in
Poland
since
Communism
collapsed
in
1989
.

Tusk
,
54
,
has
promised
to
continue
cautious
economic
reforms
if
he
retains
power
,
and
has
made
clear
he
will
press
on
with
efforts
to
ensure
stable
relations
with
Poland
’s
large
and
powerful
neighbours
,
Germany
and
Russia
.

But
some
opinion
polls
before
the
election
showed
former
premier
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
conservative
-
nationalist
Law
and
Justice
party
catching
up
in
second
place
,
and
pollsters
said
it
could
challenge
Civic
Platform
if
the
voter
turnout
is
low
.

The
election
commission
said
23
percent
of
voters
had
cast
ballots
by
2.00
p.m.
(
1200
GMT
)
and
commentators
said
this
could
point
to
a
low
turnout
.

Kaczynski
rails
against
Germany
and
Russia
and
his
return
to
power
after
four
years
in
opposition
could
threaten
ties
with
Poland
’s
largest
neighbours
,
and
political
stability
,
but
he
would
have
difficulty
building
a
stable
coalition
.

“
Democracy
is
strong
through
participation
.

With
a
20
-
30
percent
turnout
,
democracy
wilts
before
our
very
eyes
.

I
hope
the
turnout
will
be
at
least
middling
and
not
dramatically
lower
than
normal
,
”
former
president
Aleksander
Kwasniewski
said
.

No
party
is
expected
to
win
an
outright
majority
and
another
four
years
of
coalition
government
are
likely
in
the
country
of
more
than
38
million
people
after
Civic
Platform
’s
four
-
year
alliance
with
the
Peasants’
Party
.

President
Bronislaw
Komorowski
,
who
hails
from
Tusk
’s
party
,
made
clear
he
expected
coalition
talks
to
start
quickly
after
the
election
and
added
:

I
will
begin
them
with
the
leader
of
the
victorious
party
.

Tusk
portrays
himself
as
a
guardian
of
stability
.

A
mild
-
mannered
pragmatist
with
a
common
touch
,
he
has
eschewed
radical
economic
reforms
,
avoided
talk
of
austerity
despite
a
large
budget
deficit
and
promised
to
continue
cautious
reforms
.

“
PO
(
Civic
Platform
)
should
continue
to
govern
because
they
have
done
a
great
deal
.

Just
look
at
the
roads
,
”
said
Maria
Mlodzikowska
,
an
80-year
-
old
retired
physical
education
teacher
,
after
voting
in
Warsaw
.

Law
and
Justice
has
promised
more
state
involvement
in
the
economy
,
including
a
bank
tax
and
higher
taxes
for
the
rich
,
and
vowed
to
wind
down
large
-
scale
privatisation
.

The
Law
and
Justice
-
led
coalition
collapsed
in
acrimony
in
2007
.

Jan
Mazur
,
a
74-year
-
old
retired
printer
,
said
he
had
voted
for
Law
and
Justice
for
the
sake
of
his
grandchildren
.

“
I
do
n’t
want
them
to
grow
up
in
a
country
which
owns
nothing
because
the
PO
has
sold
everything
off
under
the
pretext
of
what
they
call
privatisation
,
”
he
said
.

Ratings
agencies
say
they
could
downgrade
Poland
if
it
does
not
swiftly
act
to
reduce
the
budget
deficit
,
expected
to
reach
5.6
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
this
year
,
and
the
public
debt
,
expected
to
reach
53.8
percent
of
GDP
this
year
.

Economists
doubt
Law
and
Justice
would
be
able
to
meet
the
challenge
.

The
current
coalition
,
however
,
has
failed
to
deliver
on
promises
of
far
-
reaching
liberal
market
reforms
.

The
EU
’s
largest
former
communist
economy
has
lost
some
of
its
lustre
since
2007
,
but
Poland
was
the
only
EU
state
to
maintain
positive
growth
through
the
turmoil
of
2008
-
2009
and
growth
is
forecast
to
be
about
4
percent
this
year
.

If
Tusk
wins
but
can
not
build
a
strong
coalition
with
just
the
Peasants’
Party
,
he
could
turn
for
support
to
leftist
deputies
or
parties
,
or
to
Palikot
’s
Movement
,
a
new
party
that
has
criticised
the
powerful
Catholic
Church
.

The
party
,
led
by
Civic
Platform
defector
Janusz
Palikot
,
supports
gay
rights
,
abortion
and
legalisation
of
soft
drugs
.

“
I
support
Palikot
...
at
least
he
’ll
be
a
breath
of
fresh
air
in
the
stiflingly
stodgy
Sejm
,
”
said
Krystyna
Celinska
,
a
28-year
-
old
graphic
artist
.

Tusk
favours
deeper
EU
integration
for
the
NATO
member
state
and
has
built
up
relations
with
Moscow
and
Berlin
.

Kaczynski
,
62
,
distrusts
both
—
Poland
was
carved
up
under
a
Nazi
-
Soviet
pact
before
World
War
Two
—
and
raised
eyebrows
during
the
election
campaign
by
repeating
in
a
new
book
his
view
that
Berlin
is
trying
to
subdue
Poland
.

“
I
back
PiS
(
Law
and
Justice
)
because
they
put
Poland
’s
interests
ahead
of
those
of
Brussels
or
Berlin
,
”
said
Maria
Derkacz
,
a
translator
in
her
early
60s
.

Tusk
has
continued
the
rapprochement
with
Moscow
,
which
held
sway
over
Poland
for
decades
after
World
War
Two
,
despite
strains
over
a
plane
crash
last
year
that
killed
then

Lech

TRIPOLI
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Workers
protesting
at
the
headquarters
of
Libya
’s
National
Oil
Company
on
Sunday
said
they
would
strike
until
managers
were
replaced
and
possibly
tried
for
fighting
alongside
Gaddafi
.

Most
of
the
crowd
worked
for
Waha
Oil
,
a
joint
venture
with
American
firms
ConocoPhillips
,
Marathon
and
Amerada
Hess
.

Documents
proving
managers
had
used
the
Waha
Oil
complex
as
a
base
for
Gaddafi
fighters
had
been
presented
to
the
NOC
chairman
that
morning
,
protesters
said
.

The
oil
fields
had
been
targeted
by
NATO
because
they
were
used
to
feed
,
shelter
and
equip
loyalist
fighters
,
according
to
the
workers
,
who
said
it
could
take
four
to
six
months
to
restart
flows
.

“
There
is
a
lot
of
damage
at
the
fields
...
especially
at
Gialo
and
Waha
,
”
said
Ahmed
Zahmun
,
a
Waha
Oil
protester
.

In
an
interview
last
week
,
the
NOC
’s
chairman
told
Reuters
that
NATO
airstrikes
on
Libyan
oil
fields
had
been
executed
with
“
surgical
precision
”
.

A
source
at
NOC
confirmed
Nouri
Berouin
,
the
chairman
,
had
met
Waha
Oil
workers
on
Sunday
,
but
added
requests
to
remove
directors
had
not
been
heeded
.

Other
North
American
firms
in
Libya
are
facing
contrasting
fortunes
,
with
Occidental
and
Suncor
both
restarting
production
at
fields
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
Sirte
basin
this
week
.

European
companies
,
including
German
,
Italian
and
French
oil
firms
,
have
also
succeeded
in
pumping
oil
for
the
first
time
since
war
broke
out
,
but
they
have
met
with
mixed
fates
as
well
.

Last
week
an
operations
manager
at
Eni
’s

headquarters
in
Tripoli
told
Reuters
the
Italian
oil
and
gas
company
’s
largest
oilfield
,
Elephant
,
lay
in
ruins
and
would
not
restart
until
2012
.

Eni
’s
CEO
later
said
the
company
did
not
know
of
any
damage
to
the
field
.

So
far
,
oil
has
yet
to
flow
from
the
West
and
parts
of
Libya
’s
oil
-
rich
basin
remain
too
dangerous
to
inspect
.

Waha
Oil
pumped
just
under
400,000
barrels
of
oil
per
day
(
bpd
)
before
the
war
,
but
is
now
producing
no
crude
and
field
workers
say
they
will
not
return
until
managers
were
replaced
.

Protesters
said
Libyans
had
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
get
a
good
job
throughout
Gaddafi
’s
rule
and
wanted
a
better
future
.

“
After
more
than
40
years
,
we
are
still
relying
on
foreign
workers
.

Libyans
have
no
chance
to
get
a
good
position
.

There
is
no
future
strategy
,
”
said
Ahmed
Zahmoul
.

Sunday
’s
protest
followed
a
similar
demonstration
last
week
at
Waha
Oil
’s
headquarters
.

Engineers
there
reported
damage
was
severe
in
parts
of
the
complex
,
while
some
oil
fields
were
still
unsafe
to
visit
.

Waha
Oil
workers
were
joined
by
employees
at
the
Libyan
Petroleum
Institute
,
who
also
said
their
managers
had
actively
supported
Gaddafi
’s
army
.

The
army
came
there
for
rifles
and
machine
guns
,
”
said
Ibrahim
Twebti
,
an
employee
at
the
institute
.

Punishment
was
up
to
the
Libyan
court
charged
with
processing
Gaddafi
loyalists
,
protesters
said
,
but
whatever
the
result
,
managers
were
unqualified
for
their
jobs
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
stay
on
.

We
want
to
change
that
,
”
said
Hatem
Wafa
,
a
geophysicist
at
the
protest
.

Egypt
’s
Orascom
Telecom

appointed
Khalid
Ellaicy
as
the
firm
’s
new
chief
financial
officer
(
CFO
)
to
start
on
Oct.
17
,
the
firm
said
in
a
statement
on
Sunday
.

Ellaicy
replaces
Aldo
Mareuse
who
joined
Orascom
as
the
group
’s
CFO
in
2002
.

The
new
CFO
has
over
26
years
of
experience
in
the
finance
sector
and
was
partner
in
KPMG
Egypt
.

He
assisted
in
Orascom
’s
initial
public
offering
(
IPO
)
and
later
worked
with
Mobinil

as
the
firm
’s
CFO
,
the
company
said
.

Hopes
may
be
disappointed
for
an
influx
of
money
from
Qatar
and
other
rich
Gulf
states
into
battered
European
banks
,
since
Gulf
investors
are
likely
to
see
many
of
the
banks
as
too
risky
and
out
of
line
with
their
investment
strategies
.

As
Europe
’s
banking
system
has
weakened
over
the
last
several
months
,
financial
markets
have
been
abuzz
with
rumors
and
media
reports
about
possible
investments
from
the
Gulf
—
particularly
from
cash
-
rich
Qatar
,
which
has
been
on
an
international
acquisitions
spree
.

Analysts
and
bankers
said
it
was
possible
that
Qatar
would
make
relatively
small
investments
,
perhaps
of
several
hundred
million
euros
,
in
European
financial
firms
.

Some
European
media
reports
last
week
said
Qatar
was
part
of
an
international
consortium
discussing
a
purchase
of
Dexia
’s
Luxembourg
arm
,
valued
at
some
900
million
euros
(
$
1.2
billion
)
.

But
analysts
said
Qatar
and
other
Gulf
states
were
unlikely
to
invest
aggressively
enough
to
make
much
difference
to
big
European
financial
institutions
.

“
Not
even
Qatar
’s
pockets
are
deep
enough
to
really
throw
meaningful
capital
at
the
European
financial
system
.

They
could
participate
in
some
of
the
capital
raising
that
banks
are
doing
,
but
ultimately
,
public
multilateral
support
is
needed
,
”
said
Rachel
Ziemba
,
director
at
Roubini
Global
Economics
in
London
.

“
Investors
like
Qatar
will
be
seriously
looking
to
see
whether
the
macroeconomic
framework
and
policy
response
will
give
them
a
good
return
on
their
investment
.

Qatar
was
slow
to
invest
in
the
first
round
of
bank
recaps
in
2008
to
2009
,
and
actually
extracted
some
of
the
stronger
returns
.

A
Doha
-
based
financial
industry
executive
said
he
believed
Qatar
was
probably
“
talking
with
every
bank
in
Europe
.

But
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
negotiations
will
lead
to
anything
concrete
.

Official
data
are
not
available
but
Qatar
’s
sovereign
wealth
fund
,
the
Qatar
Investment
Authority
(
QIA
)
,
is
estimated
to
have
assets
worth
around
$
70
billion
,
of
which
an
unknown
proportion
is
currently
uninvested
and
available
for
new
deals
.

But
analysts
said
the
Alpha
Bank
merger
did
not
indicate
Qatar
was
willing
to
take
on
financial
sector
risk
on
a
large
scale
—
especially
at
a
time
when
,
like
other
Gulf
states
,
it
is
seeking
to
ensure
political
stability
with
a
sharp
boost
in
government
spending
.

Qatar
has
roughly
doubled
some
public
sector
salaries
and
pensions
this
year
.

“
I
think
the
Qataris
would
be
looking
for
value
,
and
European
banks
will
have
to
get
cheaper
and
more
desperate
before
Qatar
would
jump
in
,
”
one
Doha
-
based
analyst
said
.

“
It
would
not
be
on
the
scale
that
would
have
a
massive
impact
on
the
crisis
.

Qatar
will
hardly
be
a
white
knight
,
but
rather
take
a
more
opportunistic
approach
.

Other
Gulf
states
may
be
even
more
cautious
,
analysts
said
.

The
Abu
Dhabi
Investment
Authority
has
some
$
600
billion
of
assets
,
but
Abu
Dhabi
was
required
to
bail
out
Dubai
during
a
property
market
crash
two
years
ago
and
if
the
global
economy
worsens
,
it
may
yet
need
to
provide
more
support
.

Saudi
Arabia
also
has
a
huge
financial
war
chest
,
but
its
government
embarked
this
year
on
a
$
130
billion
spending
program
on
housing
and
other
projects
.

With
global
oil
prices
approaching
levels
at
which
its
budget
surplus
could
disappear
,
it
may
not
want
to
undertake
risky
new
investments
abroad
.

Another
issue
for
Qatar
and
other
Gulf
states
is
whether
European
financial
investments
would
serve
their
long
-
term
,
strategic
aims
.

Increasingly
,
the
Gulf
is
looking
to
Asia
for
growth
and
investment
,
while
investing
in
energy
and
technology
projects
might
make
more
sense
than
buying
into
an
apparent
sunset
industry
such
as
Western
banking
.

“
I
would
expect
Qatar
and
other
Gulf
SWFs
(
sovereign
wealth
funds
)
to
continue
to
look
for
solid
investments
that
are
available
cheaply
,
but
they
are
not
altruistic
per
se
,
”
Ziemba
said
.

“
They
are
looking
to
make
financial
returns
and
invest
in
companies
that
help
extend
their
supply
chain
,
help
Qatar
...
enter
new
supply
chains
and
gain
access
to
key
technology
transfer
through
partnerships
to
help
build
up
human
capital
.

Moreover
,
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
comfortable
European
governments
will
be
with
foreign
sovereign
wealth
funds
taking
on
a
significant
share
in
banking
and
corporations
.

The
financial
market
speculation
about
Qatar
’s
intentions
resembles
that
over
China
.

Rumors
have
abounded
this
year
that
Beijing
will
deploy
more
of
its
$
3.2
trillion
in
foreign
exchange
reserves
to
buy
the
government
debt
of
Greece
and
other
weak
European
countries
.

But
so
far
,
Chinese
buying
has
not
prevented
a
collapse
of
the
bond
prices
of
indebted
European
states
.

There
is
no
evidence
that
China
is
buying
more
euro
zone
bonds
than
the
weighting
of
the
euro
in
its
reserves
would
indicate
,
and
many
of
the
bonds
it
does
hold
are
believed
to
be
German
and
other
top
-
quality
credits
,
not
the
debt
of
weak
countries
.

U.S.
crop
supply
-
demand
data
and
solid
rains
forecast
for
the
parched
southern
Plains
breadbasket
will
compete
in
agricultural
futures
markets
with
the
European
debt
crisis
to
see
if
fundamentals
or
risk
-
off
sentiment
will
prevail
this
week
.

Lower
on
the
radar
will
be
a
Senate
vote
on
a
bill
aimed
at
pressing
China
into
raising
the
value
of
its
currency
,
which
some
grains
analysts
fear
could
draw
fire
from
the
top
buyer
of
U.S.
soybeans
and
importer
of
U.S.
corn
.

Traders
will
also
watch
the
corn
and
soybean
harvest
,
with
clear
skies
paving
the
way
for
the
best
week
so
far
in
the
Midwest
grain
belt
.

Chicago
Board
of
Trade
grain
futures
have
been
taking
price
direction
the
last
few
weeks
largely
from
macroeconomic
factors
centered
on
Europe
’s
debt
crisis
and
the
gyrating
dollar
,
even
as
the
world
’s
biggest
corn
and
soy
harvest
progressed
,
with
prices
dropping
to
multi
-
month
lows
.

CBOT
wheat
futures
and
soybean
futures
fell
for
the
fifth
straight
week
last
week
,
while
corn
was
able
to
snap
a
five
-
week
losing
streak
,
but
just
barely
.

Despite
the
big
slump
in
prices
—
corn
is
down
25
percent
from
its
all
-
time
high
near
$
8
per
bushels
set
in
June
and
wheat
on
the
cusp
of
slipping
below
$
6
per
bushel
—
analysts
are
not
convinced
the
market
is
near
a
bottom
.

“
I
’m
not
banking
on
a
rebound
,
”
said
grains
analyst
Karl
Setzer
of
MaxYield
Cooperative
in
West
Bend
,
Iowa
.

It
’s
a
hard
time
for
commodities
to
rally
.

The
underlying
mind
-
set
of
the
market
is
for
speculators
to
not
buy
the
breaks
and
sell
during
rallies
,
”
he
added
.

Germany
and
France
,
the
top
two
economies
in
Europe
,
were
split
ahead
of
a
summit
on
Sunday
over
how
to
recapitalize
shaky
European
banks
and
counter
a
sovereign
debt
crisis
that
threatens
to
stall
the
global
economic
recovery
.

Rating
agency
Fitch
cut
Italy
’s
sovereign
debt
rating
by
one
notch
and
Spain
’s
by
two
,
citing
a
worsening
of
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
and
a
risk
of
fiscal
slippage
.

Fears
that
Greece
could
default
on
its
debt
escalated
,
chilling
investments
in
risky
assets
such
as
commodities
.

The
EU
has
put
on
another
Band

Aid

”
Setzer
said
.

Fears
of
a
Greek
default
triggering
a
contagion
across
Europe
and
slowing
global
growth
has
led
money
managers
to
cut
bullish
bets
in
corn
and
soy
for
a
fifth
straight
week
.

But
they
still
hold
a
sizable
net
long
position
in
CBOT
corn
of
115,255
contracts
,
and
27,448
contracts
in
soybeans
,
and
analysts
fear
further
liquidation
.

The
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
’s
supply
-
demand
report
on
Wednesday
could
offer
price
direction
as
it
updates
U.S.
corn
and
soybeans
production
and
ending
stocks
data
.

The
report
follows
one
on
quarterly
grain
stocks
last
week
that
took
traders
by
surprise
as
corn
stocks
came
in
17
percent
above
an
average
trade
estimate
.

“
Traders
were
shell
-
shocked
by
the
quarterly
stocks
numbers
,
”
said
grains
analyst
Mike
Zuzolo
of
Global
Commodity
Analytics
in
Lafayette
,
Indiana
.

Zuzolo
said
he
was
expecting
the
USDA
to
slightly
increase
its
estimate
of
U.S.
corn
yield
,
adding
that
a
recent
drop
in
prices
have
helped
to
lift
export
demand
for
soybeans
.

A
Reuters
Poll
showed
analysts
on
average
expected
the
USDA
to
marginally
raise
corn
yield
to
148.8
bushels
per
acre
from
148.1
bushels
in
September
.

They
were
expecting
the
soy
yield
to
be
unchanged
at
41.8
bushels
per
acre
.

Zuzolo
also
said
there
was
some
concern
over
the
Senate
’s
bill
on
the
Chinese
currency
.

China
is
buying
a
lot
more
corn
and
pork

and
they
are
the
No

buyer
of

Air
passengers
in
Germany
may
face
delays
this
week
due
to
separate
actions
by
ground
handling
staff
and
possibly
by
air
traffic
controllers
.

At
10
German
airports
,
including
major
hubs
Frankfurt
and
Munich
,
several
thousand
ground
handling
staff
will
hold
meetings
on
Monday
afternoon
to
discuss
European
Commission
plans
to
boost
competition
among
ground
handling
services
at
airports
.

In
Frankfurt
alone
,
around
1,200
staff
,
or
about
80
percent
of
ground
handlers
,
will
take
part
in
the
meetings
,
a
regional
spokesman
for
service
trade
union
Verdi
said
on
Sunday
.

Germany
’s
largest
airline
,
Lufthansa
said
disruption
of
services
,
such
as
flight
delays
,
was
likely
.

“
We
are
actively
preparing
for
it
and
hope
to
limit
the
effect
on
passengers
as
much
as
possible
,
”
a
Lufthansa
spokeswoman
said
.

Verdi
called
the
meetings
to
inform
ground
handlers
about

EU
commissioner
Siim
Kallas’
plan
to
force
airports
to
allow
at
least
three
ground
handling
providers
to
operate
on
their
premises
instead
of
the
current
two
.

In
addition
,
air
traffic
controllers
may
take
action
this
week
after
their
union
on
Friday
rejected
a
mediator
’s
proposal
in
a
wage
dispute
.

The
union
’s
wage
bargaining
committee
is
due
to
meet
on
Monday
to
discuss
the
further
course
of
action
.

The
union
has
pledged
to
give
24
hours’
notice
of
any
work
stoppage
.

The
union
’s
chief
negotiator
,
Dirk
Vogelsang
,
on
Sunday
said
that
if
the
union
did
opt
to
strike
,
the
strike
would
certainly
come
this
week
.

Air
traffic
controllers
would
stick
to
their
plans
for
six
-
hour
work
stoppages
if
it
does
come
to
a
strike
,
Vogelsang
said
.

Two
strikes
planned
by
the
air
traffic
controllers
in
August
,
which
besides
Lufthansa
could
also
have
affected
Air
Berlin
,
Thomas
Cook
’s
airline
Condor
and
TUI
,
were
averted
at
the
last
minute
.

POPRAD
,
Slovakia
,
Oct.
9
(
Reuters
)
-
The
Volkswagen
,
Peugeot
and
Kia
car
plants
along
the
main
highway
illustrate
Slovakia
’s
transformation
from
ex
-
communist
backwater
to
euro
zone
success
,
the
world
’s
top
auto
maker
per
capita
.

They
also
explain
its
dilemma
over
Greece
.

No
strangers
to
privations
and
harsh
economic
reform
,
Slovaks
are
divided
over
whether
their
government
should
agree
to
increasing
the
powers
of
the
fund
set
up
to
help
Greece
and
other
euro
zone
countries
that
have
lived
beyond
their
means
.

So
laborious
is
EU
decision
-
making
,
that
one
dissenting
voice
among
the
17
countries
that
use
the
euro
could
wreck
the
latest
plan
.

It
’s
a
debate
the
rest
of
the
world
is
following
with
concern
.

Should
Slovakia
,
the
single
currency
’s
second
poorest
member
,
pay
for
countries
like
Greece
,
which
borrowed
too
much
,
fudged
data
and
spurned
the
thorough
economic
reforms
that
Slovaks
endured
to
join
the
euro
in
2009
?

The
Greeks
have
big
pensions
and
retire
early
.

I
’ll
have
to
work
until
I
’m
65
to
help
pay
off
the
loans
that
our
government
will
have
to
take
out
to
pay
for
Greece
’s
mistakes
,
”
said
Dana
Antasova
,
a
31-year
-
old
economist
on
maternity
leave
in
the
north
Slovak
city
Poprad
.

They
stole
everything
,
and
now
they
want
money
from
us
?
”

The
reason
for
resentment
is
clear
.

Salaries
in
the
country
of
5.4
million
average

only
780
euros
a
month
—
just
a
tad
over
a
minimum
wage
of
750
euros
a
month
in
Greece
—
and

mothers
like
Antasova
live
off
of
a
subsidy
of
just
11
euros
a
day
.

Polls
show
Slovaks
are
split
evenly
over
whether
Prime
Minister
Iveta
Radicova
’s
government
should
ratify
the
expansion
of
the
European
Financial
Stability
Facility
,
the
euro
zone
’s
bailout
fund
for
countries
in
crisis
.

A
rebel
party
in
the
ruling
coalition
,
the
liberal
Freedom
and
Solidarity
(
SaS
)
,
is
threatening
to
vote
against
on
Oct.
11
.

But
while
many
people
agree
with
SaS
and
say
Greece
should
be
allowed
to
go
bankrupt
,
they
are
also
worried
that
a
Slovak
“
no
”
could
prompt
another
global
recession
and
threaten
an
economy
that
is
mainly
driven
by
exports
to
euro
zone
partners
.

Slovakia
’s
main
highway
is
lined
by
factories
owned
by
three
big
car
makers
and
scores
of
other
firms
that
flooded
into
the
country
after
1998
when
reformists
ousted
the
authoritarian
government
that
held
sway
after
communism
.

The
auto
plants
produced
almost
700,000
cars
in
2008
just
before
the
global
financial
crisis
hit
,
making
Slovakia
the
world
’s
biggest
producer
of
vehicles
per
capita
.

Samsung
and
Foxconn
also
produce
flat
screen
monitors
and
other
electronics
,
a
Whirlpool
site
cranks
out
white
goods
in
the
foothills
of
the
Tatra
mountains
,
and
thousands
of
workers
sweat
in
the
forges
of
U.S.
Steel
in
the
city
of
Kosice
.

But
those
industries
took
a
major
hit
two
years
ago
,
the
same
year
Slovaks
adopted
the
euro
,
when
falling
demand
in
the
currency
bloc
caused
a
9-month
spell
of
double
digit
drops
in
industry
and
pushed
unemployment
to
a
five
-
year
high
of
13
percent
.

Now
,
in
a
rare
moment
of
harmony
,
workers
and
industrialists
have
joined
forces
to
scold
their
politicians
for
holding
up
the
EFSF
expansion
,
fearing
that
a
delay
could
cause
another
painful
downturn
.

“
Even
though
it
is
difficult
and
Slovakia
is
not
in
a
good
social
situation
,
(
the
EFSF
)
is
necessary
,
”
Emil
Machyna
,
head
of
the
200,000
strong
industry
,
transport
and
services
union
OZ
KOVO
,
told
Reuters
.

“
We
need
to
stand
in
solidarity
within
the
euro
zone
,
save
what
can
be
saved
and
to
not
have
a
further
impact
on
employment
,
a
fall
in
production
,
or
a
new
recession
.
”

To
prepare
itself
for
joining
the
European
Union
,
which
it
joined
in
2004
,
and
the
euro
,
Slovakia
slashed
public
spending
,
introduced
a
flat
19
percent
tax
,
and
sold
off
dozens
of
state
-
owned
companies
.

A
cut
to
long
-
term
unemployment
benefits
caused
riots
in
the
country
’s
largely
impoverished
Roma
community
in
2004
,
and
unions
are
now
planning
a
strike
this
week
due
to
low
salaries
.

But
many
say
the
pain
was
worth
it
.

Slovakia
led
the
EU
in
growth
by
expanding
10.5
percent
in
2007
,
and
purchasing
power
has
risen
half
to
74
percent
of
the
EU
average
since
2000
,
a
trend
businesses
say
is
largely
due
to
euro
membership
.

The
fact
that
we
are
exporting
cars
into
the
rest
of
Europe
,
the
stability
of
the
European
economy
is
of
the
utmost
importance
,
”
said
Dusan
Dvorak
,
a
spokesman
for
Kia
autos
in
Slovakia
.

Radicova
,
who
has
said
she
had
a
personal
commitment
to
ratifying
the
EFSF
,
put
it
more
bluntly
:

If
we
reject
the
EFSF
,
we
can
forget
about
economic
growth
.
”

SaS
leader
Richard
Sulik
and
his
coalition
partners
argued
their
way
out
of
contributing
to
a
first
Greek
rescue
package
but
now
his
party
is
the
only
one
blocking
the
new
measures
.

With
21
of
the
coalition
’s
77
votes
,
it
can
prevent
a
majority
in
the
150
seat
parliament
.

Now
he
complains
that
average
paid
Slovaks
will
have
to
work
twice
as
hard
as
their
German
counterparts
-
300
hours
versus
120
for
Germans
-
to
pay
for
their
part
of
their
countries’
contributions
to
the
EFSF
.

“
We
will
pay
the
highest
price
in
the
euro
zone
,
”
he
told
television
TA3
on
Sunday
.

Without
Slovak
ratification
,
the
fund
’s
new
powers
ca
n’t
go
live
.

A
political
source
said
the
ruling
coalition
’s
other
three
parties
would
push
through
the
EFSF
’s
expansion
with
opposition
support
if
next
Tuesday
’s
vote
fails
,
even
if
it
leads
to
the
collapse
of
the
government
or
early
elections
.

Employers
are
losing
their
patience
.

“
We
appeal
to
all
political
parties
that
are
fundamentally
rejecting
a
joint
and
coordinated
approach
in
the
euro
zone
to
realise
that
their
stance
is
very
bad
and
one
that
Slovakia
can
not
afford
to
take
,
”
said
Klub
500
,
an
association
of
500
businesses
that
employ
more
than
80,000
workers
.

Slovakia
still
trails
countries
like
Greece
,
where
purchasing
power
is
89
percent
of
the
bloc
’s
.

People
like
Marta
Brnova
worry
that
failure
to
pass
the
EFSF
could
end
the
game
of
catch
up
.

“
It
would
hit
us
for
sure
,
”
said
Brnova
,
a
26-year
-
old
receptionist
for
Johnson
Controls
,
a
company
that
is
part
of
the
huge
car
industry
supply
chain
.

And
after
all
this
work
,
we
do
n’t
want
some
other
country
to
overtake
us
.

In
Bratislava
,
people
rejoiced
two
years
ago
when
their
crown
currency
vanished
and
their
bank
machines
started
spitting
out
the
same
euros
they
could
get
half
an
hour
away
in
Vienna
.

It
was
a
small
victory
for
a
nation
that
trailed
its
larger
former
federation
partner
,
the
Czech
Republic
,
in
terms
of
economic
performance
and
international
image
after
the
two
split
in
the
so
-
called
“
Velvet
Divorce
”
in
1993
.

After
a
decade
of
playing
troublemaker
on
the
European
Union
’s
eastern
frontier
in
the
1990
’s
under
xenophobic
and
diplomatically
isolated
former
Prime
Minister
Vladimir
Meciar
,
many
Slovaks
cringe
at
the
idea
of
rocking
the
euro
zone
boat
.

Generally
,
we
condemn
the
populism
that
some
political
parties
are
engaging
in
,
”
said
Miroslav
Gazdik
,
head
of
KOZ
,
the
umbrella
group
that
represents
all
union
members
in
Slovakia
’s
2
million
strong
workforce
.

“
I
think
that
,
as
a
small
country
,
we
ca
n’t
behave
like
the
bellybutton
of
the
world
.

If
we
want
to
exist
in
the
community
and
use
certain
benefits
we
have
contribute
with
something
to
the
club
.

Investors
tiring
of
the
euro
zone
’s
debt
crisis
dragging
the
market
all
over
the
place
are
hoping
to
focus
on
something
else
this
week
—
earnings
.

But
will
third
-
quarter
results
be
enough
to
drive
the
S&P
500
higher
?

Or
will
Europe
’s
woes
get
in
the
way
?

The
unofficial
start
of
earnings
season
begins
on
Tuesday
,
when
Dow
component
Alcoa
Inc
reports
third
-
quarter
results
after
the
close
of
trading
.

The
earnings
and
guidance
that
may
follow
could
give
investors
some
clues
on
the
health
of
the
global
economy
,
including
any
impact
the
euro
-
zone
debt
crisis
has
had
and
might
continue
to
have
on
profits
.

But
even
if
earnings
paint
a
rosier
picture
than
anticipated
,
stocks
may
face
a
stiff
test
in
climbing
much
further
,
as
analysts
pointed
to
the
declining
50-day
moving
average
as
a
key
resistance
point
that
could
limit
gains
.

Last
week
’s
sharp
gains
were
built
on
improved
hopes
that
European
officials
will
get
a
handle
on
the
euro
-
zone
debt
crisis
.

That
fed
a
massive
bout
of
short
-
covering
as
those
betting
against
stocks
were
forced
to
buy
shares
to
avoid
losing
money
.

The
benchmark
S&P
500
index

rose
2.1
percent
for
the
past
week
,
buoyed
by
a
6
percent
jump
mid
-
week
,
as
it
appeared
plans
in
the
euro
zone
to
get
a
grip
on
the
debt
crisis
were
moving
forward
.

The
region
remains
a
wild
card
,
which
could
cause
any
gains
to
quickly
vanish
.

For
the
next
three
weeks
,
in
this
country
,
earnings
will
be
the
focus
and
the
subplot
is
going
to
be
Europe
—
Europe
is
always
going
to
be
just
under
the
surface
,
”
said
Ken
Polcari
,
managing
director
at
ICAP
Equities
in
New
York
.

“
But
if
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
middle
of
next
week
,
some
catastrophe
happens
in
Europe
,
the
focus
is
immediately
going
to
be
headline
driven
and
goes
back
to
Europe
.

Other
companies
expected
to
post
quarterly
results
this
week
include
PepsiCo
Inc
,
tech
giant
Google
Inc
,
JPMorgan
Chase
&
Co
and
toy
maker
Mattel
Inc
.

Clouding
the
picture
for
profits
is
the
fact
that
many
earnings
estimates
have
been
trimmed
by
analysts
in
light
of
the
turmoil
in
Europe
,
a
staggering
global
economy
and
other
events
which
resulted
in
a
more
cautious
forecast
.

“
You
’ve
got
to
remember
what
was
going
on
in
July
with
the
debt
-
ceiling
crisis
,
credit
default
—
companies
were
not
willing
to
go
out
on
a
limb
and
make
any
big
expectations
,
”
said
Marc
Pado
,
a
U.S.
market
strategist
at
Cantor
Fitzgerald
&
Co.
in
San
Francisco
.

So
they
were
conservative
going
in
,
and
we
have
not
seen
a
whole
lot
of
downward
revisions
,
which
suggests
companies
are
probably
going
to
be
able
to
make
those
numbers
.

The
economic
calendar
for
this
week
includes
the
FOMC
minutes
from
the
two
-
day
meeting
in
late
September
,
along
with
import
prices
and
retail
sales
for
September
,
in
addition
to
the
preliminary
reading
on
October
consumer
sentiment
from
the
Thomson
Reuters
/
University
of
Michigan
surveys
.

Economic
data
of
late
has
been
better
than
expected
,
helping
to
quell
fears
that
the
economy
was
headed
for
a
double
-
dip
recession
.

Once
again
,
that
leaves
the
euro
-
zone
crisis
as
a
potential
landmine
to
disrupt
a
slow
move
higher
.

“
The
reason
we
have
lifted
in
the
past
week
is
the
rhetoric
has
improved
and
we
are
seeing
progress
,
not
necessarily
a
plan
,
but
you
are
getting
countries
to
admit
to
the
problem
,
and
that
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
—

you
have
to
seek
help
before
you
can
get
help
,
”
Pado
said
.

“
That
is
all
we
really
need
in
order
to
get
beyond
this
,
and
start
focusing
on
the
future
and
focusing
on
our
own
data
.

We
have
plenty
of
data
that
suggests
slow
growth
,
but
nothing
that
suggests
waving
the
red
flag
like
a
crazy
person
saying
,
‘
How
can
you
not
see
this?’

Hugh
Osmond
’s
Sun
Capital
Partners
remains
in
talks
over
buying
some
630
Lloyds
retail
bank
branches
,
although
Sun
Capital
has
concerns
over
the
costs
of
a
bid
,
said
a
source
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
.

“
We
remain

there
is
the
issue
of

,
which
is
more
than

estimate
,
”
said
the
source
,
who
declined
to
be
identified
.

The
Sunday

had
earlier
reported
that
Sun
Capital
had
withdrawn
from
the
race
to
buy
the
branches
.

The
newspaper
said
it
understood
Sun
Capital
was
“
unlikely
”
to
enter
a
second
-
round
bid
for
the
branches
,
which
Lloyds
has
been
ordered
to
sell
by
European
regulators
after
the
bank
was
rescued
by
the
British
taxpayer
.

New
British
bank
venture
NBNK
confirmed
last

that
it
had
submitted
a

to
be

LONDON
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Vodafone
on
Sunday
launched
a
broadside
against
3
,
its
smaller
rival
in
the
British
mobile
market
,
over
the
increasingly
controversial
auction
of
next
-
generation
4
G
mobile
spectrum
.

British
regulator
Ofcom
on
Friday
delayed
the
launch
of
the
auction
by
six
months
to
the
end
of
next
year

so
it
could
again
consult
on
the
rules
,
which
have
been
the
subject
of
heated
argument
among
the
four
network
operators
and
other
interested
parties
.

Ofcom
had
proposed
strict
limits
on
the
amount
of
spectrum
an
operator
could
buy
in
a
bid
to
protect
the
smallest
operator
,
Hutchison
’s
3
.

3
is
opposed
to
a
delay
in
the
process
because
it
is
at
risk
of
running
out
of
capacity
on
its
3
G
network
,
where
demand
is
booming
thanks
to
network
-
hungry
handsets
like
the
iPhone
.

With
no
2
G
spectrum
,
3
can
not
take
advantage
of
Ofcom
’s
January
decision
to
allow
operators
to
reuse
2
G
spectrum
for
3
G
services
.

UK
chief
executive
Guy
Lawrence
told
the
Sunday
Telegraph
that
3
was
“
running
around
the
playground
complaining
that
they
’re
being
bullied
by
the
older
boys
”
,
when
in
fact
the
operator
sold
more
Apple
iPhones
than
Vodafone
,
O2
,
or
Everything
,
Everywhere
.

A
3
spokesman
told
the
newspaper
that
the
auction
could
not
be
viewed
in
isolation
.

“
It
is
intended
to
address
the
massive
competitive
and
commercial
imbalance
created
by
the
decision
in
January
,

A

for
McCartney
told
Reuters
in
an
email
:
“
We
are
not
commenting
.

The
Daily
Mirror
quoted
a
source
close
to
McCartney
as
saying
:
“
The
wedding
is
in
keeping
with
the
way
Paul
and
Nancy
have
conducted
their
entire
relationship
—
low
-
key
,
understated
and
fueled
by
goodwill
.

Neither
of
them
want
a
huge
fuss
made
and
the
main
priority
for
both
was
family
.

The
wedding
will
be
followed
by
a
reception
held
in
McCartney
’s
back
garden
,
the
paper
said
.

Shevell
,
51
,
who
is
divorced
,
and
McCartney
,
69
,
are
believed
to
have
begun
dating
after
his
bitter
split
with
second
wife
,
former
model
Heather
Mills
.

McCartney
and
Mills
were
we
d
in
2002
in
a
lavish
ceremony
at
Castle
Leslie
in
Ireland
estimated
by
celebrity
magazines
to
have
cost
around
$
3.2
million
.

But
four
years
later
they
confirmed
they
had
separated
,
blaming
media
intrusion
into
their
private
lives
,
and
in
2008
the
couple
divorced
.

McCartney
has
a
son
,
two
daughters
and
a
stepdaughter
from
his
marriage
to
Linda
and
a
daughter
from
his
union
with

BERLIN
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
France
and
Germany
will
present
proposals
on
a
new
comprehensive
package
for
stabilising
the
euro
zone
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
said
on
Sunday
.

“
We
are
very
conscious
that
France
and
Germany
have
a
particular
responsibility
for
stabilising
the
euro
,
”
Sarkozy
said
at
a
joint
news
conference
with
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
in
Berlin
.

“
We
need
to
deliver
a
response
that
is
sustainable
and
comprehensive
.

We
have
decided
to
provide
this
response
by
the
end
of
the
month
because
Europe
must
solve
its
problems
by
the
G20
summit
in
Cannes
,
”
he
added
,
saying
it
was
too
early
to
enter
into
details
.

The
leaders
suggested
that
their
proposals
would
include
a
plan
for
recapitalising
European
banks
,
accelerating
economic
coordination
in
the
euro
zone
and
dealing
with
Greece
’s
debt
problems
.

A
former
Miss
Iceland
who
met
Boston
crime
boss

Whitey
”
Bulger
and
his
girl
friend
in
California
was
paid
a
$
2
million
reward
for
the
tip
that
led
to
Bulger
’s
arrest
in
June
,
the
Boston
Globe
said
on
Sunday
.

The
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
paid
the
reward
money
to
Anna
Bjornsdottir
,
a
one
-
time
model
and
Miss
Iceland
1974
who
had
gotten
to
know
Bulger
’s
girl
friend
Catherine
Greig
after
the
two
women

both
took
a
shared
interest
in
a
local
stray
cat
while
the
fugitive
couple
hid
out
in
Santa
Monica
.

Bulger
and
Greig
had
assumed
new
identities
during
more
than
a
decade
on
the
run
from
federal
charges
,
and
appeared
to
neighbors
to
be
a
modest
retired
couple
.

But
it
was
Bjornsdottir
,
the
newspaper
reported
,
who
recognized
Bulger
in
a
news
report
this
summer
while
she
was
back
in
Reykjavik
and
called
authorities
.

After
the
tip
,
Bulger
and
Greig
were
arrested
in
June
without
incident
at
their
Santa
Monica
apartment
building
in
June
.

Property
records
showed
they
moved
into
a
two
-
bedroom
unit
in
April
1998
,
playing
$
863
a
month
.

Authorities
have
said
they
found
about
30
firearms
and
$
822,000
in
cash
hidden
in
the
walls
of
their
apartment
.

The
FBI
had
said
in
September
it
had
paid
$
2.1
million
to
“
more
than
one
individual
”
for
information
that
led
to
the
arrests
of
Bulger
and
Greig
,
but
had
not
given
more
detail
.

The
newspaper
reported
Bjornsdottir
had
collected
$
2
million
of
the
$
2.1
million
in
FBI
rewards
for
her
tip
.

A
call
to
the
FBI
’s
Boston
office
was
not
immediately
returned
on
Sunday
.

Bulger
had
fled
Boston
after
hearing
from
a
corrupt
FBI
agent
that
he
was
about
to
be
indicted
.

Greig
joined
him
a
short
time
later
and
has
been
charged
with
harboring
Bulger
as
a
fugitive
.

Past
Boston
FBI
officials
had
used
Bulger
as
an
informant
for
years
against
other
organized
crime
factions
and
,
later
investigations
found
,
tolerated
or
enabled
his
own
ongoing
criminal
activities
in
what
an
appeals
court
in
a
related
case
earlier
this
year
termed
an
“
unholy
alliance
.
”

Bulger
,
who
for
years
led
the
Boston
-
based
Winter
Hill
Gang
,
faces
charges
that
include
19
alleged
murders
from
the
1970s
and
1980s
.

Both
Bulger
and
Greig
have
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
charges
against
them
.

Through
her
husband
,
Bjornsdottir
declined
to
speak
to
the
Globe
,
the
newspaper
said
.

She
had
moved
to
Southern
California
in
the
late
1970
’s
and
appeared
in
cosmetics
commercials
.

More
recently
she
had
befriended
Greig
after
noticing
her
feeding
a
local
cat
,
the
paper
reported
.

The
newspaper
described
her
currently
as
a
“
57-year
-
old
yoga
instructor
and
graphic
designer
.

The
Globe
story
also
included
many
details
of
Bulger
’s
time
on
the
run
,
including
how
Bulger
assumed
the
identity
of
a
local
homeless
man
to
obtain
medicine
and
keep
a
bank
account
.

LONDON
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Willie
Walsh
,
chief
executive
of
British
Airways
owner
International
Airline
Group
,
has
poured
cold
water
on
a
plan
to
link
London
’s
Heathrow
and
Gatwick
airports
by
high
-
speed
rail
.

The
British
government
said
on
Saturday
that
it
was
considering
connecting
the
airports
—
creating
a
virtual
hub
dubbed
Heathwick
—
to
increase
capacity
in
the
London
aviation
market
after
it
rejected
a
third
runway
at
Heathrow
.

The
challenges
(
Heathwick
)
faces
are
very
significant
,
”
Walsh
told
the
Sunday
Telegraph
.

I
do
n’t
know
how
long
it
would
take
to
develop
.

I
do
n’t
know
how
much
it
would
cost
.
”

Walsh
said
he
believed
that
shelving
the
plan
for
a
third
runway
at
Heathrow
,
which
would
have
been
funded
by
the
airlines
using
the
airport
,
would
be
viewed
in
future
years
as
a
“
huge
mistake
”
.

The
Heathwick
scheme
,
which
was
reported
by
the
Financial
Times
to
cost
5
billion
pounds
(
$
7.8
billion
)
,
would
be
included
in
the
Government
’s
review
of
aviation
policy
in
spring
2012
,
a
Department
for
Transport

said

Zsa
Zsa
Gabor
remained

on

and
was
doing
“
a

,
”
but
stomach
surgery
to
reattach
a
feeding
tube
was
delayed
as
she
continues
to
run
a
high

,
her
husband
said
.

Frederic
Prinz

told

the
94-year

old

who
has
suffered
ill
health
for
well
over
a
year
was
taking
“
very

”
and
that
her

pressure
was
down
.

Gabor
was
taken
to

von

said
at
the
time
that
her

“

”
Sarkozy
said
at

conference
with

Merkel
in
Berlin
.

“
We
need
to
deliver
a
response
that
is
sustainable
and
comprehensive
.

We
have
decided
to
provide
this
response
by
the
end
of
the
month
because
Europe
must
solve
its
problems
by
the
G20
summit
in
Cannes
,
”
he
added
,
saying
it
was
too
early
to
enter
into
details

The
leaders
suggested
that
their
proposals
would
include
a
plan
for
recapitalizing
European
banks
,
accelerating
economic
coordination
in

CAIRO
(
Reuters
)
-
Egypt
’s
ruling
military
council
has
amended
election
rules
to
ban
the
use
of
religious
slogans
,
a
move
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
said
Sunday
may
prompt
it
to
reconsider
using
its
traditional
campaign
phrase
“
Islam
is
the
solution
.
”

The
Brotherhood
was
banned
under
the
ousted
President
Hosni
Mubarak
but
ran
candidates
as
“
independents
,
”
who
could
be
identified
on
posters
by
the
Islamist
group
’s
well
-
known
slogan
.

Many
liberal
politicians
and
Egyptians
have
been
worried
by
the
rising
influence
of
the
Brotherhood
since
the
uprising
.

The
group
has
sought
to
quell
concerns
by
saying
it
wants
a
pluralist
democracy
and
did
not
want
to
impose
Islamic
law
.

“
Electoral
campaigns
based
on
the
use
of
religious
slogans
or
on
racial
or
gender
segregation
are
banned
,
”
a
military
council
decree
issued
late
Saturday
said
,
adding
violators
could
face
three
months
in
jail
and
be
fined
.

The
election
committee
earlier
said
the
Brotherhood
’s
Freedom
and
Justice
party
could
not
use
the
slogan
,
prompting
some
members
to
insist
it
should
be
allowed
.

But
Brotherhood
officials
took
a
softer
line
after
the
army
decree
.

but
it
is
n’t
necessarily
an
electoral
slogan
,
”
Mohamed
el
-
Beltagy
,
a
senior
figure
in
the
Freedom
and
Justice
party
,
told
Reuters
after
the
decree
.

“
We
might
reconsider
using
it
in
the
elections
in
light
of
the
conditions
and
might
replace
it
,
”
with
other
slogans
,
he
said
.

The
Brotherhood
has
been
more
accommodating
of
the
army
than
some
activists
,
which
analysts
say
is
because
it
does
not
want
to
disrupt
an
election
process
that
will
strengthen
its
role
and
prevent
a
return
to
repression
it
faced
under
Mubarak
.

Voting
in
a
parliamentary
election
starts
on
November
28
.

Egyptian
law
bars
political
parties
based
on
religion
,
just
as
it
did
under
Mubarak
.

But
the
Brotherhood
’s
Freedom
and
Justice
party
won
approval
by
saying
Islam
was
a
“
reference
”
and
it
was
a
civil
party
that
did
not
seek
to
impose
Islamic
law
.

One
Islamist
group
that
sought
to
establish
a
party
was
barred
.

The
parties’
committee
said
that
was
because
it
called
for
implementing
Islamic
law
and
also
because
one
of
its
founders
had
been
jailed
over
his
role
in
the
assassination
of
President
Anwar
Sadat
in
1981
,
barring
him
from
politics
.

Despite
saying
the
Brotherhood
would
reconsider
using
the
slogan
,
Beltagy
said
it
should
be
allowed
under
the
article
of
the
constitution
that
cites
Islamist
sharia
law
as
the
principle
source
of
legislation
.

The
parliament
will
choose
an
assembly
to
draw
up
a
new
constitution
.

Liberals
are
concerned
that
Islamists
will
dominate
parliament
,
which
will
influence
the
contents
of
a
new
constitution
.

Analysts
said
the
amendment
to
election
rules
reflected
the
military
council
’s
eagerness
for
a
civil
state
and
worries
expressed
by
those
opposed
to
the
Islamists
.

It
indicates
the
rising
concern
of
other
civil
streams
who
are
concentrating
their
campaigns
now
,
”
said
Hossam
Tammam
,
an
expert
on
Islamic
groups
.

Amendments
to
the
election
rules
announced
Saturday
also
outlined
one
to
five
-
year
prison
terms
and
fines
for
anyone
using
force
,
threats
,
cash
or
other
steps
to
prevent
voters
from
casting
ballots
or
forcing
them
to
choose
a
specific
candidates
.

Rights
groups
said
such
tactics
were
common
in
elections
under
Mubarak
whose
now
defunct
National
Democratic
Party
routinely
secured
sweeping
victories
.

The
council
said
such
punishments
would
also
apply
to
those
who
published
or
circulated
false
information
about
candidates
behavior
with
the
intention
of
influencing
voters
.

Under
pressure
form
political
parties
,
the
military
council
has
also
expanded
from
a
half
to
two
thirds
the
numbers
of
seats
elected
according
to
party
lists
,
reducing
the
seats
offered
to
individuals
.

Parties
will
be
able
to
field
candidates
on
lists
or
for
seats
open
to
individuals
.

British
Defense
Secretary
Liam
Fox
is
under
pressure
over
reports
that
one
of
closest
friends
put
national
security
at
risk
.

A
report
into
whether
Fox
,
50
,
breached
ministerial
conduct
rules
will
be
handed
to
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
on
Monday
.

Following
are
some
key
facts
on
Fox
:

—
Fox
has
asked
his
permanent
secretary
to
investigate
claims
that
his
links
with
a
friend
and
unofficial
adviser
,
Adam
Werritty
,
might
have
threatened
national
security
.

The
opposition
Labour
Party
wants
to
know
why
he
visited
the
Ministry
of
Defense
14
times
in
the
past
16
months
,
despite
him
not
being
on
its
payroll
and
without
security
clearance
.

—
Media
coverage
has
also
questioned
whether
Werritty
accompanied
Fox
on
any
official
overseas
trips
.

Although
Werritty
is
not
part
of
Fox
’s
team
of
officials
,
he
is
reported
to
have
handed
out
embossed
cards
describing
himself
as
“
adviser
”
to
the
minister
.

—
Media
reported
at
the
weekend
that
Werritty
had
arranged
and
attended
a
meeting
in
Dubai
in
June
between
Fox
and
a
company
seeking
to
transfer
communications
technology
.

*
Fox
has
served
as
Defense
secretary
since
the
coalition
took
power
in
May
2010
,
a
high
profile
role
with
almost
10,000
British
troops
in
Afghanistan
and
Britain
helping
to
protect
civilians
in
Libya
after
the
uprising
against
Muammar
Gaddafi
.

*
Fox
came
into
conflict
with
Cameron
and
Finance
Minister
George
Osborne
last
year
when
he
was
fighting
to
protect
Defense
from
deep
budget
cuts
,
with
a
series
of
newspaper
leaks
from
within
his
department
seen
as
part
of
that
campaign
.

In
the
end
,
the
Defense
budget
was
cut
by
eight
percent
,
against
cuts
of
around
20
percent
in
most
departments
.

*
Fox
,
who
is
on
the
right
of
the
party
,
won
plaudits
for
cleaning
up
the
finances
of
the
department
and
had
recently
been
spoken
of
again
as
an
eventual
long
-
term
successor
to
Cameron
.

He
describes
himself
as
a
“
hawk
on
Defense
and
on
the
deficit
”
.

*
He
stood
for
the
party
leadership
in
2005
and
was
defeated
by
Cameron
.

His
political
leanings
were
in
evidence
last
month
when
former
Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
made
a
rare
public
appearance
at
his
50th
birthday
party
.

—
Fox
,
who
has
a
taste
for
publicity
,
was
pictured
in
an
electric
blue
shirt
—

the
color
of
the
Conservative
Party
—
holding
the
arm
of
the
frail
former
premier
.

*
Born
in
September
1961
and
brought
up
in
Scotland
,
Fox
studied
medicine
at
the
University
of
Glasgow
and
became
president
of
the
University
’s
Conservative
and
Unionist
Association
.

*
He
worked
as
a
Civilian
Army
Medical
Officer
and
as
a
general
practitioner
.

*
He
became
a
Conservative
MP
in
1992
for
Woodspring
,
and
for
North
Somerset
since
the
May
2010
general
election

The
fate
of
Britain
’s
Defense
Secretary
Liam
Fox
may
be
decided
next
week
after
claims
his
relationship
with
a
close
friend
and
unofficial
adviser
may
have
breached
national
security
.

The
role
of
defense
secretary
is
particularly
sensitive
in
Britain
because
of
the
involvement
of
about
10,000
British
troops
in
Afghanistan
and
its
role
in
helping
NATO
protect
civilians
in
Libya
after
the
uprising
against
Muammar
Gaddafi
.

Fox
returned
to
Britain
on
Sunday
from
Libya
where
his
first
visit
to
the
country
was
overshadowed
by
the
saga
.

Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
has
demanded
the
initial
findings
of
an
inquiry
arrive
on
his
desk
on
Monday
after
media
furor
surrounding
his
minister
’s
ties
with
a
former
flatmate
and
best
man
at
his
wedding
,
Adam
Werritty
,
refused
to
go
away
.

Although
Cameron
has
said
he
has
“
full
confidence
”
in
Fox

,
the
48-hour
deadline
was
shorter
than
the
two
-
week
deadline
Fox
gave
a
top
military
civil
servant
to
carry
it
out
.

One
defense
analyst
said
Fox
,
who
has
been
defense
secretary
since
the
Conservative
-
led
coalition
came
to
power
in
2010
,
would
fight
to
keep
his
job
,
saying
Fox
’s
behavior
was
more
a
case
of
poor
judgment
than
a
risk
to
national
security
.

But
the
opposition
is
calling
for
a
wider
inquiry
,
and
will
push
for
Fox
to
make
an
emergency
statement
to
parliament
on
Monday
,
where
he
is
already
due
to
answer
defense
questions
.

not
just
the
questions
of

told
BBC
television
on
Sunday
.

But
there
’s
now
a
further
question
about
Dr
Fox
’s
integrity
and
the
question
of
whether
he
actually
answered
truthfully
and
fully
all
the
questions
that
have
been
put
.

Fox
,
on
the
right
of
Cameron
’s
Conservatives
and
seen
as
a
leadership
challenger
,
is
skeptical
on
Europe
and
in
favor
of
close
cooperation
with
the
United
States
on
defense
issues
.

His
departure
would
leave
Cameron
searching
for
someone
of
similar
political
leanings
to
avoid
accusations
that
his
coalition
with
the
Liberal
Democrats
was
getting
dragged
too
far
into
the
center
ground
of
British
politics
.

Werritty
’s
14
visits
to
the
ministry
in
the
past
16
months
,
without
security
clearance
and
despite
not
being
on
its
payroll
,
are
being
questioned
as
well
as
whether
he
accompanied
Fox
on
official
overseas
trips
,
and
set
up
business
meetings
,
including
one
in
Dubai
in
June
,
where
ministry
officials
were
not
present
.

Although
Werritty
is
not
part
of
Fox
’s
team
of
officials
,
he
is
reported
to
have
handed
out
embossed
cards
describing
himself
as
“
adviser
”
to
the
minister
.

In
Misrata
,
Fox
told
Reuters
,
when
asked
if
the
coverage
was
overshadowing
his
role
as
defense
secretary
:
“

Well
,
of
course
,
that
’s
what
those
who
raised
the
stories
intended

and
they
’re
allowed
to
do
that
in
a
democratic
society
.

He
described
the
claims
as
“
utterly
baseless
.
”

Fox
,
who
stood
against
Cameron
for
party
leadership
in
2005
,
came
into
conflict
with
him
again
last
year
as
leaks
emerged
when
his
department
successfully
fought
deep
budget
cuts
.

Fox
’s
status
among
defense
chiefs
took
a
dent
though
when
he
blamed
them
for
overspending
,
but
he
won
plaudits
in
other
circles
for
cleaning
up
the
department
’s
finances
.

A
retired
senior
military
official
,
who
declined
to
be
named
said
:
“
If
there
is
any
real
substance
to
this
story
,
that
may
undermine
his
position
,
but
so
far
,
I
’m
not
convinced
there
is
.

Every
minister
’s
got
mates
who
he
deals
with
,
who
they
use
as
their
confidantes
.

Defense
analyst
Paul
Beaver
said
:
“
We
will
look
back
at
his
tenure
as
defense
secretary
in
a
decade
’s
time
and
will
remember
what
was
a
very
successful
campaign
(
Libya
)
.

He
is
a
fighter
,
I
think
he
firmly
believes
he
has
done
nothing
of
a
resignation
issue
.

Liberia
became
for
many
a
byword
for
savagery
as
up
to
a
quarter
of

million
people
were
killed
in
a
civil

Still
haunted
by
memories
of
West
Africa
’s
bloodiest
civil
war
,
Liberians
hope
Tuesday
’s
presidential
election
will
shore
up
peace
and
lay
the
basis
for
prosperity
instead
of
producing
the
grist
for
more
violence
.

President
Ellen
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
,
who
shared
this
year
’s
Nobel
Peace
Prize
,
faces
chief
rival
Winston
Tubman
and
14
others
in
the
second
presidential
vote
since
the
end
of
fighting
that
killed
200,000
people
and
left
Liberia
in
ruins
.

Chevron
,
Anadarko
and
others
are
drilling

oil
this

,
steel
giant
ArcelorMittal
is
a
few
weeks

Liberia

“
We

tired
of

and
if
anyone
thinks
of
coming
with
war
,
that
person
will
be
the
first
to
die
.

Rufus
Yarmie
,
a
resident
of
Tappita
in
Liberia

,
said
a
peaceful
vote
was
more
important
in
a
country
where
average
income
is
around
$
300
a
year
than
who
actually
won
.

“
We
are
more
concerned
about
peace
and
acceptability
of
the
results
by
all
parties
,
”
he
said
by

Citing
persistent

the

mercenaries
from

Reminders
of
Liberia
’s
own
14
years
of
fighting
,
which
ran
until
2003
,
are
everywhere
—
a
U.N.

in
front
of
the
Ministry

Foreign
affairs
,
war
-
wounded
begging
in
the

,
bullet
-
riddled
buildings
.

Both
Tubman
and
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
are
from
the
higher
echelons
of
society
.

Tubman
as
one
of
the
Americo
-
Liberians
who
dominated
much
of
its
history
after
its
1847
founding
by
freed
U.S.
slaves
.

While
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
is
not
Americo
-
Liberian
herself
,
her
mother
and
father
were
both
raised
by
Americo
-
Liberians
.

Tubman
,
a
Harvard
-
educated
nephew
of
former
president
William
Tubman
and
a
former
senior
U.N.
diplomat
,
is
expected
by
many
Liberians
to
give
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
her
toughest
challenge
.

His
running
mate
is
superstar
soccer
player
George
Weah
,
who
lost
to
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
in
2005
.

Tubman
vows
to
accept
the
results
of
a
free
and
fair
vote
,
but
also
says
he
is
“
100
percent
certain
”
of
victory
and
that
anyone
else
claiming
a
win
could
find
it
difficult
to
govern
.

“
These
tens
of
thousands
you
have
seen
in
Monrovia
and
other
places
demonstrating
and
clamoring
with
passion
for
us

,
they
will
not
accept
being
cheated
,
”
he
said
in
an
interview
with
Reuters
on
Saturday
.

The
Carter
Center
,
a
U.S
.-
based
democracy
watchdog
,
described
campaigning
as
“
vibrant
”
but
cautioned
it
had
observed
opposition
parties
being
refused
the
use
of
public
facilities
and
the
ruling
party
using
public
resources
for
campaigning
.

If
Sirleaf
does
win
,
it
wo
n’t
be
an
easy
victory
.

Violence
ca
n’t
be
ruled
out
,
especially
considering
the
tone
of
the
campaigns
in
recent
weeks
and
reports
that
opposition
parties
have
been
denied
access
to
public
facilities
,
”
said
Titi
Ajayi
,
analyst
at
International
Crisis
Group
.

Sirleaf
’s
Nobel
Prize
could
give
her
a
boost
at
the
polls
—
and
even
the
absolute
majority
needed
to
win
in
the
first
round
—
particularly
if
it
succeeds
in
galvanizing
the
women
’s
vote
behind
her
,
analysts
said
.

(
It
)
gives
her
a
distinct
advantage
over
her
rivals
,
provided
poor
Liberians
understand
what
it
means
and
how
it
affects
their
lives
for
the
better
,
”
said
Lydie
Boka
,
head
of
France
-
based
risk
consultancy
StrategiCo
.

“
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
is
a
symbol
in
a
continent
where
women
are
not
on
the
forefront
to
say
the
least
.
”

Speaking
at
a
rally
on
Sunday
,
Liberian
women
rights
activist
and
fellow
Nobel
laureate
Leymah
Gbowee
publicly
endorsed
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
for
president
—
potentially
raising
her
chances
of
securing
the
female
vote
.

But
her
critics
have
said
the
prize
is
evidence
only
of
her
international
fame
—
not
her
domestic
record
,
which
includes
controversy
over
her
temporary
support
to
a
rebellion
by
notorious
warlord
Charles
Taylor
against
ex
-
president
Samuel
Doe
and
impatience
with
the
slow
pace
of
reconstruction
.

A
former
Citigroup
and
World
Bank
economist
,
Johnson
-
Sirleaf
became
African
’s
first
freely
elected
head
of
state
in
2005
,
earning
support
from
the
United
States
,
and
has
convinced
donors
to
write
off
billions
of
dollars
of
the
country
’s
debt
.

She
has
admitted
providing
food
,
supplies
and
financing
to
Charles
Taylor
,
notorious
for
his
child
armies
and
now
facing

A
cyclical
drop
in
the
sun
’s
radiation
can
trigger
unusually
cold
winters
in
parts
of
North
America
and
Europe
,
scientists
say
,
a
finding
that
could
improve
long
-
range
forecasts
and
help
countries
prepare
for
blizzards
.

Scientists
have
known
for
a
long
time
that
the
sun
has
an
11-year
cycle
during
which
radiation
measured
by
sunspots
on
the
surface
reaches
a
peak
then
falls
.

But
pinning
down
a
clear
link
to
weather
has
proved
harder
.

“
Our
research
confirms
the
observed
link
between
solar
variability
and
regional
winter
climate
,
”
lead
author
Sarah
Ineson
of
the
UK
Met
Office
told
Reuters
in
an
email
.

The
study
was
published
in
the
journal
Nature
Geoscience
on
Monday
.

Her
team
focused
on
data
from
the
recent
solar
minimum
during
2008
-
10
,
a
period
of
unusual
calm
for
the
sun
and
intense
winters
in
the
United
States
and
parts
of
Europe
that
shut
down
air
travel
and
disrupted
businesses
.

The
researchers
found
that
a
reduction
in
ultraviolet
(
UV
)
radiation
from
the
sun
can
affect
high
-
altitude
wind
patterns
in
the
Northern
Hemisphere
,
triggering
cold
winters
.

While
UV
levels
wo
n’t
tell
us
what
the
day
-
to
-
day
weather
will
do
,
they
provide
the
exciting
prospect
of
improved
forecasts
for
winter
conditions
for
months
and
even
years
ahead
.

These
forecasts
play
an
important
role
in
long
-
term
contingency
planning
,
”
Ineson
,
a
climate
scientist
,
said
.

Ineson
and
colleagues
from
the
Imperial
College
London
and
the
University
of
Oxford
used
satellite
data
that
more
accurately
measures
UV
radiation
from
the
sun
and
found
a
much
greater
variability
than
previously
thought
.

They
found
that
in
years
of
low
activity
,
unusually
cold
air
forms
high
in
the
atmosphere
over
the
tropics
.

This
causes
a
redistribution
of
heat
in
the
atmosphere
,
triggering
easterly
winds
that
bring
freezing
weather
and
snow
storms
to
northern
Europe
and
the
United
States
and
milder
weather
to
Canada
and
the
Mediterranean
.

When
solar
UV
radiation
is
stronger
,
the
opposite
occurs
.

Ineson
’s
team
used
the
data
in
a
complex
computer
model
that
simulates
long
-
term
weather
patterns
.

The
model
successfully
reproduced
what
scientists
have
observed
happening
in
the
upper
atmosphere
during
changes
in
solar
radiation
.

A
key
uncertainty
in
the
experiment
lay
in
the
satellite
data
used
,
because
it
spans
only
a
few
years
.

So
questions
remain
concerning
both
accuracy
and
also
applicability
to
other
solar
cycles
,
”
she
said
.

FRANKFURT
(
Reuters
)
-
Eckhard
Cordes
,
chief
executive
of
German
retailer
Metro
MEOG.DE
,
said
he
no
longer
wishes
to
renew
his
contract
,
just
weeks
after
winning
support
from
the
group
’s
top
shareholder
.

Cordes
had
seemed
in
danger
of
losing
his
job
last
month
after
reports
that
he
had
fallen
out
of
favor
with
some
supervisory
board
members
,
who
were
due
to
vote
later
in
the
autumn
on
whether
his
contract
would
be
extended
past
October
2012
.

However
,
he
battled
for
support
among
other
members
of
the
board
and
in
a
rare
public
statement
,
the
Haniel
family
,
which
owns
34.24
percent
of
Metro
,
said
they
were
in
favor
of
a
contract
extension
for
Cordes
.

Cordes
,
who
informed
the
supervisory
board
and
major
shareholders
of
his
decision
on
Sunday
,
criticized
the
public
debate
over
his
contract
,
saying
it
threatened
to
harm
the
company
,
its
principal
shareholders
and
himself
.

Due
to
the
incidents
of
the
recent
weeks
and
months
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trustful
basis
to
stay
on
as
the
head
of
Metro
’s
top
management
does
not
anymore
exist
,
”
he
said
in
a
statement
on
Sunday
.

The
Metro
share
price
has
also
slumped
38
percent
this
year
on
fears
of
lackluster
consumer
spending
and
as
sales
dropped
at
one
-
time
star
performer
MediaMarkt
-
Saturn
,
the
chain
of
consumer
electronics
stores
majority
owned
by
the
group
.

A
source
close
to
the
company
said
Cordes
would
not
leave
Metro
straight
away
and
would
stay
on
until
a
succession
process
had
been
decided
.

A
separate
source
also
close
to
the
company
said
that
Cordes
was
likely
to
leave
over
the
European
winter
and
that
current
Chief
Financial
Officer
Olaf
Koch
might
take
the
helm
on
an
interim
basis
until
a
new
chief
executive
were
found
.

The
Haniel
family
,
which
holds
the
Metro
stake
via
the
Franz
Haniel
&
Cie
investment
company
,
said
in
a
statement
that
Cordes’
decision
merited
“
our
recognition
and
respect
.

The
Schmidt
-
Ruthenbeck
family
,
who
own
around
16
percent
of
Metro
and
were
also
in
favor
of
a
contract
extension
for
Cordes
,
said
on
Sunday
they
regretted
Cordes’
decision
.

“
We
believe
Cordes
staying
would
have
been
best
for
the
further
development
of
Metro
.

Therefore
we
would
like
him
if
possible
to
stay
until
his
contract
expires
,
”
said
Peter
Kuepfer
,
who
represents
the
family
on
the
Metro
supervisory
board
.

NEW
YORK
/
SAN
FRANCISCO
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-

For
the
last
few
years
,
a
widely
circulated
joke
about
Jerry
Yang
was
that
he
had
the
best
tan
in
Silicon
Valley
from
all
the
time
he
spent
on
Stanford
University
’s
golf
course
.

But
the
jests
stopped
about
six
months
ago
,
when
the
Yahoo
Inc
co
-
founder
and
former
CEO
put
away
his
golf
clubs
and
began
showing
up
on
a
daily
basis
at
the
Internet
company
’s
headquarters
in
Sunnyvale
,
California
,
according
to
a
high
-
ranking
Yahoo
executive
.

Now
,
Yang
is
interested
in
a
deal
with
private
equity
firms
that
would
take
the
$
20
billion
company
off
public
markets
,
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
situation
.

Such
a
deal
would
involve
rolling
over
Yang
’s
stake
in
Yahoo
,
which
stood
at
3.63
percent
as
of
April
2
.

Yahoo
’s
other
co
-
founder
,
David
Filo
,
would
likely
follow
Yang
’s
lead
and
roll
over
his
stake
,
said
other
sources
close
to
Yahoo
.

Filo
held
5.90
percent
of
Yahoo
’s
shares
as
of
May
11
.

Shortly
after
firing
Carol
Bartz
as
CEO
in
September
,
Yahoo
and
its
longtime
advisers
at
Allen
&
Co
and
Goldman
Sachs
began
working
on
a
strategic
review
,
which
could
include
a
sale
of
the
Internet
pioneer
,
after
receiving
unsolicited
expressions
of
interest
.

Jack
Ma
,
CEO
of
Chinese
e
-
commerce
giant
Alibaba
,
said
last
month
that
he
would
be
“
very
interested
”
in
buying
Yahoo
,
a
deal
that
could
help
the
former
English
school
teacher
expand
into
the
U.S.

Microsoft
Corp
is
also
considering
bidding
for
Yahoo
,
as
is
Silver
Lake
Partners
,
Providence
Equity
Partners
and
Hellman
&
Friedman
,
Reuters
reported
last
week
.

Another
private
firm
that
has
expressed
interest
in
Yahoo
is
Bain
Capital
,
a
source
said
.

Bain
has
invested
heavily
in
several
media
companies
including
Clear
Channel
Communications
and
The
Weather
Channel
in
recent
years
.

A
Bain
spokesman
declined
to
comment
.

Yahoo
declined
to
detail
Yang
’s
current
role
other
than
to
say
,
“
The
entire
Board
,
including
Jerry
,
is
fully
aligned
and
unanimous
in
support
of
the
comprehensive
scope
of
the
ongoing
strategic
review
.

As
always
,
Jerry
’s
singular
focus
remains
to
serve
the
best
interests
of
Yahoo
—
its
shareholders
,
employees
,
users
and
advertisers
.

Three
years
ago
,
Microsoft
offered
$
33
per
share
,
or
$
47.5
billion
,
to
acquire
Yahoo
.

Yang
and
the
board
turned
down
that
bid
,
to
the
regret
of
many
shareholders
.

Yahoo
’s
shares
closed
at
$
15.47
on
Friday
.

Now
Yang
,
who
turns
43
in
November
,
finds
himself
in
essentially
the
same
spot
—
trying
to
resuscitate
an
organization
where
a
lack
of
operational
vision
and
clear
leadership
has
made
it
susceptible
to
a
takeover
.

Yahoo
’s
share
of
the
U.S.
Internet
search
market
stood
at
16
percent
in
August
,
compared
with
19
percent
two
years
ago
,
according
to
ComScore
,
despite
a
deal
to
outsource
search
technology
to
Microsoft
.

In
contrast
,
Google
Inc
’s

search
share
has
been
steady
at
65
percent
,
while
Microsoft
’s
share
rose
to
15
percent
from
9
percent
two
years
ago
.

Yahoo
’s
U.S.
display
ad
impressions
fell
to
10.2
percent
in
June
,
and
time
spent
by
users
on
its
site
increased
just
1.6
percent
for
the
12
months
ended
July
2011
,
according
to
ComScore
.

By
comparison
,
Facebook
’s
ad
impressions
swelled
to
32.4
percent
in
June
2011
and
time
spent
by
users
on
its
site
jumped
58
percent
for
the
12
months
ended
July
2011
.

Yahoo
’s
advisors
are
expected
to
send
financial
information
this
week
to
interested
parties
,
said
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
.

Talks
so
far
have
been
informal
and
have
not
firmed
up
on
terms
that
would
compel
Yahoo
to
enter
into
direct
negotiations
,
said
another
source
.

There
are
several
reasons
why
Yang
might
want
to
take
Yahoo
private
.

For
starters
,
Yahoo
is
punished
by
Wall
Street
for
not
being
a
growth
company
and
its
low
stock
price
prevents
shares
from
being
used
as
currency
for
acquisitions
.

A
buyer
could
sell
off
Yahoo
’s
international
assets
,
which
include
a
partnership
with
Softbank
in
Yahoo
Japan
as
well
as
about
40
percent
stake
in
Alibaba
.

The
buyer
could
then
use
the
cash
—
estimated
to
be
upward
of
$
12
billion
—
to
pay
off
debt
.

That
would
pare
down
Yahoo
to
its
U.S.
operations
,
which
has
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
they
are
being
valued
at
just
$
5
billion
and
$
6
billion
,
according
to
two
sources
close
to
the
situation
.

Whether
Yang
will
succeed
in
taking
Yahoo
private
remains
to
be
seen
—
it
depends
on
the
terms
he
manages
to
negotiate
,
as
well
as
what
other
offers
are
on
the
table
.

Yang
still
exerts
influence
over
the
board
,
but
he
has
less
clout
with
Yahoo
management
and
staff
now
than
he
did
during
the
talks
with
Microsoft
,
according
to
current
and
former
employees
.

Executives
most
loyal
to
Yang
have
matriculated
out
of
the
company
over
the
years
,
replaced
by
a
younger
generation
.

Moreover
,
some
detractors
hold
Yang
responsible
for
refusing
Microsoft
in
2008
,
saying
his
decision
was
influenced
by
his
personal
attachment
to
Yahoo
,
rather
than
financial
considerations
.

“
The
Microsoft
decision
really
split
the
company
,
with
many
feeling
that
Jerry
’s
decision
was
bad
for
them
personally
because
he
left
a
lot
of
money
on
the
table
,
”
said
a
former
executive
who
worked
at
Yahoo
at
the
time
of
the
offer
.

Nevertheless
,
Yang
still
retains
pockets
of
support
inside
the
company
.

His
supporters
say
he
has
a
deep
concern
for
the
direction
and
culture
of
the
business
he
founded
with
Filo
in
1995
.

They
praised
Yang
for
stepping
in
again
to
try
to
lift
Yahoo
’s
fortunes
at
a
difficult
juncture
,
just
as
he
did
in
2007
when
he
assumed
the
CEO
role
from
Terry
Semel
.

Yang
also
has
a
deep
network
of
contacts
in
the
industry
and
a
reputation
for
actively
working
behind
the
scenes
.

“
He
’d
be
in
the
office
,
the
door
would
be
closed
,
he
’d
be
working
the
phones
,
but
you
would
n’t
know
who
he
’d
be
working
them
with
,
”
said
another
former
Yahoo
executive
who
worked
closely
with
Yang
.

The
Business
Insider
blog
reported
in
September
that
Yang
was
trying
to
buy
Yahoo
.

Yang
,
whose
quiet
speech
and
calm
demeanor
belie
a
fiercely
competitive
streak
,
has
a
better
chance
of
remaining
involved
with
Yahoo
in
a
management
-
led
buyout
than
an
outright
sale
.

But
private
equity
firms
also
like
to
install
their
own
management
at
companies
they
acquire
.

In
pushing
a
go
-
private
agenda
,
Yang
appears
to
be
hoping
that
his
knowledge
of
Yahoo
will
be
enough
to
convince
a
buyer
to
allow
him
to
stay
on
and
try
to
restore
the
company
to
its
former
glory
,
away
from
the
harsh
eyes
of
Wall
Street
.

Many
farm
-
related
stocks
look
cheap
considering
a
positive
long
-
term
outlook
for
the
sector
due
to
demands
to
feed
an
ever
-
growing
global
population
,
according
to
an
article
in
Barron
’s
.

Demographic
trends
suggest
enticing
opportunities
for
a
wide
range
of
companies
around
the
world
,
the

said
.

Among
the
companies
mentioned
in
the

are
Archer

FRANKFURT
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Eckhard
Cordes
,
chief
executive
of
German
retailer
Metro
,
said
he
no
longer
wishes
to
renew
his
contract
,
just
weeks
after
winning
support
from
the
group
’s
top
shareholder
.

Cordes
had
seemed
in
danger
of
losing
his
job
last
month
after
reports
that
he
had
fallen
out
of
favour
with
some
supervisory
board
members
,
who
were
due
to
vote
later
in
the
autumn
on
whether
his
contract
would
be
extended
past
October
2012
.

However
,
he
battled
for
support
among
other
members
of
the
board
and
in
a
rare
public
statement
,
the
Haniel
family
,
which
owns
34.24
percent
of
Metro
,
said
they
were
in
favour
of
a
contract
extension
for
Cordes
.

Cordes
,
who
informed
the
supervisory
board
and
major
shareholders
of
his
decision
on
Sunday
,
criticised
the
public
debate
over
his
contract
,
saying
it
threatened
to
harm
the
company
,
its
principal
shareholders
and
himself
.

Due
to
the
incidents
of
the
recent
weeks
and
months
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trustful
basis
to
stay
on
as
the
head
of
Metro
’s
top
management
does
not
anymore
exist
,
”
he
said
in
a
statement
on
Sunday
.

The
Metro
share
price
has
also
slumped
38
percent
this
year
on
fears
of
lacklustre
consumer
spending
and
as
sales
dropped
at
one
-
time
star
performer
MediaMarkt
-
Saturn
,
the
chain
of
consumer
electronics
stores
majority
owned
by
the
group
.

A
source
close
to
the
company
said
Cordes
would
not
leave
Metro
straight
away
and
would
stay
on
until
a
succession
process
had
been
decided
.

A
separate
source
also
close
to
the
company
said
that
Cordes
was
likely
to
leave
over
the
European
winter
and
that
current
Chief
Financial
Officer
Olaf
Koch
might
take
the
helm
on
an
interim
basis
until
a
new
chief
executive
were
found
.

The
Haniel
family
,
which
holds
the
Metro
stake
via
the
Franz
Haniel
&
Cie
investment
company
,
said
in
a
statement
that
Cordes’
decision
merited
“
our
recognition
and
respect
.

The
Schmidt
-
Ruthenbeck
family
,
who
own
around
16
percent
of
Metro
and
were
also
in
favour
of
a
contract
extension
for
Cordes
,
said
on
Sunday
they
regretted
Cordes’
decision
.

“
We
believe
Cordes
staying
would
have
been
best
for
the
further
development
of
Metro
.

Therefore
we
would
like
him
if
possible
to
stay
until
his
contract
expires
,
”
said
Peter
Kuepfer
,
who
represents
the
family
on
the
Metro
supervisory
board
.

Yemeni
officials
rowed
back
from
President
Ali
Abdullah
Saleh
’s
statement
that
he
would
step
down
within
“
the
coming
days
”
,
and
opponents
dismissed
the
offer
on
Sunday
as
yet
another
delaying
tactic
to
try
and
stay
in
power
.

Saleh
,
69
,
has
defied
protests
all
year
against
his
three
-
decade
rule
,
reversing
repeated
pledges
to
quit
.

The
United
States
and
Saudi
Arabia
worry
that
unrest
risks
tipping
the
dirt
-
poor
nation
into
civil
war
and
economic
collapse
.

In
a
speech
late
on
Saturday
,
Saleh
said
:
“
I
reject
power
and
I
will
continue
to
reject
it
,
and
I
will
be
leaving
power
in
the
coming
days
.

But
Deputy
Information
Minister
Abdu
al
-
Janadi
told
Reuters
Saleh
’s
departure
still
depends
on
reaching
an
agreement
,
which
had
yet
to
be
signed
.

He
said
this
to
show
his
commitment
to
this
plan
,
but
there
is
no
plan
for
a
resignation
or
transfer
of
powers
before
we
have
agreed
and
signed
a
deal
.

That
would
just
plunge
the
country
into
chaos
or
even
war
,
”
he
said
.

He
is
ready
to
leave
power
in
days
,
yes
,
but
whether
this
happens
in
the
coming
days
or
months
will
depend
on
the
success
of
negotiations
for
a
deal
.

Protests
against
Saleh
’s
rule
have
paralyzed
Yemen
,
weakening
government
control
over
swathes
of
the
country
and
fanning
fears
al
Qaeda
’s
regional
wing
may
use
the
upheaval
to
expand
its
foothold
near
Red
Sea
oil
-
shipping
routes
.

Saleh
’s
speech
may
be
intended
to
deflect
criticism
in
the
U.N.
Security
Council
,
which
is
due
to
be
briefed
on
Yemen
in
coming
days
and
could
consider
a
resolution
calling
on
Saleh
to
implement
a
power
transfer
deal
.

“
Saleh
is
a
liar
,
nothing
has
changed
since
his
speech
,
”
said
Mohammed
al
-
Asl
,
an
organizer
of
protests
by
opponents
of
Saleh
camped
out
in
a
central
square
in
the
capital
Sanaa
.

“
We
’re
used
to
this
type
of
thing
now
.

He
just
says
anything
to
fool
his
own
people
,
the
world
,
and
everyone
.

We
’re
not
paying
any
attention
to
this
.
”

Protesters
,
camped
out
in
tents
in
the
area
in
Sanaa
now
dubbed
“
Change
Square
”
,
were
going
about
their
usual
business
of
buying
food
,
cooking
and
chewing
wads
of
qat
,
a
mild
leaf
stimulant
that
is
common
in
Yemen
.

Saleh
’s
foreign
minister
met
the
ambassador
for
talks
on
Sunday
,
part
of
what
many
expect
to
be
a
diplomatic
push
to
deflect
action
by
the
Security
Council
.

New
pressure
has
come
from
an
unexpected
quarter
after
the
Nobel
Peace
Prize
was
awarded
on
Friday
to
Tawakul
Karman
,
one
of
the
leading
activists
who
has
been
on
the
street
at
“
Change
Square
”
outside
Sanaa
University
since
February
.

The
recognition
of
a
Yemeni
democracy
activist
could
refocus
global
attention
on
the
conflict
in
Yemen
,
a
state
of
23
million
people
with
declining
water
resources
,
an
imploding
economy
,
separatist
and
sectarian
conflicts
and
a
surging
al
Qaeda
wing
.

The
wily
leader
,
who
came
to
power
in
1978
,
is
under
pressure
from
international
allies
,
street
protesters
,
armed
opponents
and
opposition
parties
to
make
good
on
promises
to
hand
over
power
.

Washington
and
Riyadh
fear
Yemen
could
become
a
failed
state
overrun
by
al
Qaeda
.

Saleh
has
given
confusing
signals
about
his
intentions
since
January
when
protesters
first
took
to
the
streets
to
demand
reform
and
end
his
family
’s
authoritarian
grip
.

He
has
already
pulled
back
three
times
from
signing
a
Gulf
Arab
peace
initiative
that
would
have
seen
him
form
an
opposition
-
led
cabinet
and
then
hand
power
to
his
deputy
before
early
parliamentary
and
presidential
elections
.

He
left
the
country
for
convalescence
in
Riyadh
after
surviving
an
assassination
attempt
in
June
,
but
flew
back
unannounced
in
late
September
.

Diplomats
have
said
they
are
close
to
getting
international
consensus
on
a
Security
Council
resolution
,
which
could
come
as
early
as
this
week
,
that
would
call
on
the
government
to
implement
the
Gulf
power
transfer
plan
,
which
has
U.S.
backing
.

A
U.N.
envoy
,
Jamal
Beomar
,
left
Yemen
to
brief
the
council
last
week
after
a
fruitless
two
weeks
trying
to
mediate
between
Saleh
’s
government
and
the
opposition
.

On
Sunday
,
U.S.
Ambassador
Gerald
Feierstein
met
Yemeni
Foreign
Minister
Abubakr
Abdullah
Al
-
Qirbi
and
discussed
the
power
transfer
plan
,
Yemen
’s
official
news
agency
SABA
reported
.

This
is
all
an
effort
to
calm
the
international
community
before
the
briefing
before
the
Security
Council
,
”
said
Asl
,
the
protest
organizer
.

In
Saturday
’s
speech
,
Saleh
repeated
his
condition
that
he
would
not
cede
power
to
long
-
time
rivals
from
the
opposition
parties
,
who
he
says
have
hijacked
the
youth
activists’
protests
and
aim
to
subvert
the
constitutional
process
.

Saleh
’s
presidential
term
ends
in
2013
and
he
has
said
he
will
not
run
again
,
but
analysts
suspect
he
would
like
to
outlast
the
crisis
until
then
.

The
state
of
his
health
is
not
clear
,
though
,
after
he
was
badly
burned
in
the
June
attack
.

This
is
new
propaganda
from
Saleh
before
Yemen
is
discussed
at
the
Security
Council
,
”
said
Mohammed
al
-
Sabri
,
an
opposition
coalition
spokesman
.

Four
months
have
passed
since
he
said
he
accepted
the
Gulf
transition
deal
,
so
what
is
stopping
him
?

He
does
n’t
even
need
a
few
days
to
do
it
.
”

It
sounds
like
the
same
lie
,
the
same
speech
,
over
and
over
again
,
”
said
student
protester
Fayza
al
-
Suleimani
.

He
wants
to
relieve
pressure
from
the
U.N.
and
quiet
all
the
attention
that
was
raised
by
Tawakul
Karman
’s
Nobel
Peace
Prize
.

Even
as
Washington
has
urged
Saleh
to
accept
the
power
transfer
deal
,
it
has
relied
on
Yemen
’s
cooperation
in
its
covert
war
on
militants
based
there
.

A
CIA
drone
killed
American
-
Yemeni
cleric
Anwar
al

Awlaki
in
Yemen
last
month
in
what
was
seen
as
a
major
coup
for
U.S.
President
Barack
Obama
in
the
battle
against
al
Qaeda
.

Henkel
,
the
German
maker
of
Persil
detergent

Pritt
stick
glue
,
is
mulling
acquisitions
and
is
sticking
to
its
goals
,
its
chief

told
a

If

brings
us
forward
strategically
and
the

we

”
Kasper
Rorsted
told

newspaper
in
an

released
ahead
of
publication
on
Monday
.

Henkel
was
capable
of
paying
for
acquisitions
out
of
its
own
pocket
,
Rorsted
said
.

We
have
a
very
solid
balance
sheet
structure
and
a
strong
cash
flow
,
”
he
told
the
paper
.

The

expects
2011
sales
to
rise
about
5
percent
.

It
is
targeting
an
adjusted
EBIT
margin
of
around
13
percent
in
2011
and
14
percent
for
2012
.

“
We
are
sticking
to
our
14
percent
target
yield
and
there
is
no
reason
up
to
now
why
we
should
n’t
reach
it
,
”
Rorsted
said
.

I
also
think
it
is
dangerous
to
be
continuously
correcting
targets
.

The
current
economic
situation
is
different
from
the
global
recession
seen
in
2008
,
Rorsted
said
.

“
The
chance
of
a

is
extremely
small

told

rise
in
fuel
prices
.

Tombini
had
been
saying
a
few
months
ago
he
expected
inflation
would
peak
in
August
.

Economists
are
concerned
that
his
dovish
expectations
may
be
premature
.

In
no
way
(
will
prices
continue
to
accelerate
)
,
”
Tombini
told
the
Folha
de
S.Paulo
newspaper
published
on
Sunday
.

Our
horizon
is
December
2012
but
in
October
12-month
inflation
will
begin
to
fall
by
0.30
percentage
points
.
”

The
central
bank
expects
to
meet
its
4.5
percent
inflation
target
by
December
of
2012
,
Tombini
said
.

It
has
a
2-point
margin
on
either
side
of
the
target
.

Market
expectations
monitored
by
the
central
bank
see
inflation
at
6.52
percent
at
the
end
of
2011
,
slightly
above
the
upper
limit
of
6.5
percent
.

“
Of
those
countries
that
have
inflation
targets
,
various
economies
have
inflation
above
the
band
or
target
,
”
Tombini
said
.

After
the
Brazilian
economy
grew
by
7.5
percent
last
year
,
the
central
bank
raised
its
benchmark
Selic
interest
rate
consistently
from
the
start
of
this
year
to
12.5
percent
.

But
in
August
,
the
bank
surprised
markets
in
the
current
inflationary
climate
with
its
decision
to
cut
the
Selic
rate
by
50
basis
points
to
12
percent
.

The
bank
said
the
effects
of
the
European
debt
crisis
and
a
fragile
U.S.
economy
would
have
a
chilling
effect
on
local
demand
.

“
Since
the
start
of
the
year
,
our
flight
plan
...
was
to
moderate
the
growth
of
the
Brazilian
economy
,
”
Tombini
said
.

“
There
were
signs
,
clearer
every
day
,
that
this
slowdown
was
happening
.

We
also
said
that
monetary
policy
would
have
a
delayed
effect
and
that
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
these
policies
would
be
more
strongly
felt
.

Tombini
said
the
central
bank
’s
daily
soundings
were
showing
month
-
to
-
month
inflation
would
come
in
at
around
0.30
to
0.40
percent
in
October
,
well
below
the
0.75
percent
on
October
2010
and
below
this
September
.

This
slowing
trend
would
also
hold
through
the
end
of
the
year
,
Tombini
said
.

MILWAUKEE
(
Reuters
)
-
The
Presbyterian
Church
(
USA
)
ordained
its
first
openly
gay
minister
on
Saturday
in
Madison
,
Wisconsin
,
three
months
after
lifting
its
long
-
standing
ban
on
homosexual
clergy
.

Scott
Anderson
,
56
,
was
ordained
minister
at
the
Covenant
Presbyterian
Church
in
front
of
a
jubilant
congregation
.

It
was
a
big
day
for
me
and
also
for
the
Presbyterian
Church
,
”
Anderson
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

“
It
was
very
healing
for
me
and
for
many
people
there
.

Presbyterians
do
n’t
cheer
very
often
,
but
there
was
some
cheering
,
”
Anderson
said
.

Anderson
,
who
years
ago
had
been
rejected
by
members
of
his
congregation
at
the
Bethany
Presbyterian
Church
in
Sacramento
,
California
,
left
the
ministry
in
1990
.

He
has
been
with
his
partner
,
Ian
MacAllister
,
for
20
years
.

“
I
never
thought
the
day
would
come
in
my
life
time
when
the
Presbyterian
Church
would
change
its
mind
about
ordaining
gays
and
lesbians
,
”
he
said
.

Since
leaving
the
ministry
,
Anderson
had
remained
active
in
the
church
.

He
began
the
process
of
returning
to
the
ministry
five
years
ago
.

The
Presbyterian
Church
in
July
changed
its
constitution
to
allow
openly
gay
and
lesbian
ministers
.

It
just
so
happened
that
I
was
the
first
in
line
,
I
did
n’t
intend
to
be
the
first
,
”
Anderson
said
.

“
What
a
great
privilege
and
honor
and
humbling
to
be
the
first
.

Anderson
said
he
believes
his
ordination
reflects
a
cultural
shift
throughout
organized
religion
and
public
policy
in
the
United
States
.

“
Institutional
religion
has
not
always
been
a
helpful
conversation
partner
with
the
wider
culture
and
my
hope
and
prayer
is
that
,
with
this
action
of
the
Presbyterian
Church
,
we
will
increasingly
become
a
more
constructive
player
in
the
wider
cultural
discussion
about
gays
and
lesbians
,
”
he
said
.

spots

City
—

Bill
Hader
’s
idiosyncratic
character
welcomed
Derek
Zoolander
,
the
male
model
from
host
Ben
Stiller
’s

He
’s
spent
the
last
10
years
coming
up
with
a
new
look
that
will
make
you
forget
you
ever
stared
longingly
at
his
old
one
.

After
his
appointment
as
chief
executive
of
Dexia
SA
in
2008
,
Pierre
Mariani
took
the
first
train
from
Paris
to
Brussels
.

He
arrived
to
find
his
predecessor
Axel
Miller
still
packing
his
belongings
.

Miller
told
him
that
,
despite
a
6
billion
euro
(
$
8.1
billion
)
state
-
led
bailout
,
the
bank
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
.

Rival
banks
did
not
wish
to
lend
it
any
more
money
.

Three
years
later
,
Mariani
is
presiding
over
the
first
bank
to
fall
victim
to
the
European
sovereign
debt
crisis
.

Dexia
is
near
collapse
and
being
forced
to
rely
on
French
and
Belgian
state
support
.

A
plan
due
to
be
announced
Sunday
was
likely
to
call
for
the
break
-
up
of
the
group
into
several
units
,
including
a
“
bad
bank
”
to
handle
nonperforming

assets
.

Mariani
has
been
criticized
for
not
acting
fast
enough
to
stave
of
disaster
,
but
so
far
is
not
seen
as
the
main
culprit
.

Mr.
Mariani
is
a
firefighter
,
”
said
Michel
De
Herde
,
budget
chief
of
the
Brussels
district
of
Schaerbeek
,
a
Dexia
shareholder
.

He
fought
hard
but
he
did
n’t
manage
to
put
out
the
flames
.

Mariani
was
born
in
the
Moroccan
capital
Rabat
in
1957
,
about
a
year
after
Morocco
gained
independence
from
France
.

The
son
of
a
schoolteacher
and
a
police
officer
,
he
grew
up
in
the
southern
French
port
of
Marseille
,
attending
two
of
the
Mediterranean
city
’s
best
high
schools
.

He
then
followed
the
elite
path
of
France
’s
top
businessmen
and
public
servants
:
the
HEC
business
school
in
Paris
,
and
the
École
Nationale
d’Administration
,
the
top
training
school
for
the
nation
’s
leaders
.

Mariani
joined
the
ministry
of
finance
in
1982
and
in
1993
he
agreed
to
head
up
the
office
of
the
new
budget
minister
,
a
young
politician
called
Nicolas
Sarkozy
.

Mariani
joined
BNP
Paribas
in
1997
and
subsequently
became
responsible
for
overseas
retail
banking
.

One
of
his
coups
was
BNP
Paribas’
2006
acquisition
of
Italian
bank
BNL
.

What
could
be
more
exciting
for
me
than
to
put
a
company
like
Dexia
back
on
its
feet
—
with
its
wealth
of
talent
and
skills
—
and
give
it
a
future
again

,
”
Mariani
told
French
daily
Le
Figaro
at
the
time
.

Dexia
had
become
the
world
’s
largest
finance
provider
to
the
public
sector
after
its
2000
purchase
of
U.S.
bond
insurer
Financial
Security
Assurance
(
FSA
)
.

This
business
yielded
bumper
profits
before
the
2008
financial
crisis
.

But
Dexia
’s
key
problem
was
a
mismatch
between
the
terms
of
its
borrowing
and
lending
.

Its
business
of
financing
municipalities
and
other
public
authorities
meant
making
long
-
term
loans
.

To
finance
this
,
Dexia
relied
on
short
-
term
borrowing
.

In
the
early
and
mid
2000s
,
the
group
profited
from
the
difference
between
lower
short
-
term
interest
rates
and
higher
longer
-
term
rates
.

But
when
the
short
-
term
money
dried
up
,
the
model
collapsed
.

To
make
matters
worse
,
Dexia
has
4.8
billion
euros
of
exposure
to
Greece
,
among
the
highest
for
a
non
-
Greek
lender
.

Dexia
was
the
heaviest
user
of
the
Federal
Reserve
’s
“
discount
window
”
loans
and
soaked
up
11
percent
of
the
European
Central
Bank
’s
refinancing
during
the
crisis
at
the
end
of
2008
.

Dexia
drew
as
much
as
$
37
billion
of
Fed
‘
discount
window’
loans
,
more
than
any
other
institution
and
was
also
the
heaviest
borrower
under
the

Egypt
’s

rules
to

the

been

The

has
sought
to
quell
concerns
by
saying
it

did
not

After
his
appointment
as
chief
executive
of
Dexia
SA
in
2008
,
Pierre
Mariani
took
the
first
train
from
Paris
to
Brussels
.

He
arrived
to
find
his
predecessor
Axel
Miller
still
packing
his
belongings
.

Miller
told
him
that
,
despite
a
6
billion
euro
(
$
8.1
billion
)
state
-
led
bailout
,
the
bank
was
on
the
verge
of
collapse
.

Rival
banks
did
not
wish
to
lend
it
any
more
money
.

Three
years
later
,
Mariani
is
presiding
over
the
first
bank
to
fall
victim
to
the
European
sovereign
debt
crisis
.

Dexia
is
near
collapse
and
being
forced
to
rely
on
French
and
Belgian
state
support
.

A
plan
due
to
be
announced
Sunday
was
likely
to
call
for
the
break
-
up
of
the
group
into
several
units
,
including
a
“
bad
bank
”
to
handle
nonperforming

Mariani
has
been
criticized
for
not
acting
fast
enough
to
stave
of
disaster
,
but
so
far
is
not
seen
as
the
main
culprit
.

Mr.
Mariani
is
a
firefighter
,
”
said
Michel
De
Herde
,
budget
chief
of
the
Brussels
district
of
Schaerbeek
,
a
Dexia
shareholder
.

He
fought
hard
but
he
did
n’t
manage
to
put
out
the
flames
.

Mariani
was
born
in
the
Moroccan
capital
Rabat
in
1957
,
about
a
year
after
Morocco
gained
independence
from
France
.

The
son
of
a
schoolteacher
and
a
police
officer
,
he
grew
up
in
the
southern
French
port
of
Marseille
,
attending
two
of
the
Mediterranean
city
’s
best
high
schools
.

He
then
followed
the
elite
path
of
France
’s
top
businessmen
and
public
servants
:
the
HEC
business
school
in
Paris
,
and
the
École
Nationale
d’Administration
,
the
top
training
school
for
the
nation
’s
leaders
.

Mariani
joined
the
ministry
of
finance
in
1982
and
in
1993
he
agreed
to
head
up
the
office
of
the
new
budget
minister
,
a
young
politician
called
Nicolas
Sarkozy
.

Mariani
joined
BNP
Paribas
in
1997
and
subsequently
became
responsible
for
overseas
retail
banking
.

One
of
his
coups
was
BNP
Paribas’
2006
acquisition
of
Italian
bank
BNL
.

What
could
be
more
exciting
for
me
than
to
put
a
company
like
Dexia
back
on
its
feet
—
with
its
wealth
of
talent
and
skills
—
and
give
it
a
future
again

,
”
Mariani
told
French
daily
Le
Figaro
at
the
time
.

Dexia
had
become
the
world
’s
largest
finance
provider
to
the
public
sector
after
its
2000
purchase
of
U.S.
bond
insurer
Financial
Security
Assurance
(
FSA
)
.

This
business
yielded
bumper
profits
before
the
2008
financial
crisis
.

But
Dexia
’s
key
problem
was
a
mismatch
between
the
terms
of
its
borrowing
and
lending
.

Its
business
of
financing
municipalities
and
other
public
authorities
meant
making
long
-
term
loans
.

To
finance
this
,
Dexia
relied
on
short
-
term
borrowing
.

In
the
early
and
mid
2000s
,
the
group
profited
from
the
difference
between
lower
short
-
term
interest
rates
and
higher
longer
-
term
rates
.

But
when
the
short
-
term
money
dried
up
,
the
model
collapsed
.

To
make
matters
worse
,
Dexia
has
4.8
billion
euros
of
exposure
to
Greece
,
among
the
highest
for
a
non
-
Greek
lender
.

Dexia
was
the
heaviest
user
of
the
Federal
Reserve
’s
“
discount
window
”
loans
and
soaked
up
11
percent
of
the
European
Central
Bank
’s
refinancing
during
the
crisis
at
the
end
of
2008
.

Dexia
drew
as
much
as
$
37
billion
of
Fed
‘
discount
window’
loans
,
more
than
any
other
institution
and
was
also
the
heaviest
borrower
under
the
scheme
when
Fed
lending
to
banks
peaked
at
the
end
of
October
2008
.

Since

“
For

clung
on
to
the
power
they

seized
at
the

people
and
ignored
their
rights
and
their
hopes
for

How
tragic
that
this

be
replaced
by
another
kind

In

A
bomb
exploded
outside
a
church
in
Maiduguri
in
northeast
Nigeria
on
Sunday
,
reviving
concerns
about
a
radical
Islamist
sect
in
the
remote
region
of
Africa
’s
most
populous
nation
.

No
one
was
confirmed
dead
but
hospital
staff
said
they
had
treated
some
wounded
,
including
one
soldier
.

The
bomb
was
planted
near
a
church
where
our
boys
were
on
guard
but
fortunately
no
casualties
were
recorded
,
”
the
operations
officer
for
a
joint
military
task
force
said
.

He
did
not
confirm
whether
the
blast
was
carried
out
by
Boko
Haram
,
a
sect
whose
name
means
“
Western
education
is
forbidden
”
and
which
has
been
behind
almost
daily
shootings
or
attacks
with
homemade
explosives
in
recent
months
.

The
sect
’s
ambition
has
grown
and
Nigerian
and
foreign
officials
have
said
the
group
has
strengthening
links
with
al
Qaeda
’s
north
African
wing
.

Boko
Haram
took
responsibility
for
Nigeria
’s
first
successful
suicide
attack
in
August
,
when
the
driver
rammed
a
car
full
of
explosives
into
the
side
of
U.N.
headquarters
in
the
capital
Abuja
,
killing
23
people
.

Since
the
U.N.
blast
security
has
been
increased
in
all
major
towns
and
cities
and
scores
of
suspected
members
of
Boko
Haram
have
been
arrested
,
some
facing
trial
this
month
for
their
part
in
deadly
bombings
.

The
crackdown
reduced
the
number
of
attacks
in
the
sect
’s
home
base
in
the
dusty
northeast
but
at
least
two
people
were
killed
in
a
gunfight
last
week
and
Sunday
’s
blast
was
a
reminder
of
the
threat
still
posed
by
bombers
.

“
We
thought
peace
has
come
to
stay
and
there
wo
n’t
be
any
more
bombs

Anger
over
the
loss
of
U.S.
jobs
,
fear
that
America
’s
global
economic
dominance
is
sliding
,
and
bitter
presidential
politics
have
created
a
toxic
backdrop
for
U.S.
lawmakers
this
week
as
they
vote
on
three
free
-
trade
deals
and
a
currency
bill
aimed
at
penalizing
China
.

The
decisions
in
Congress
will
prove
an
important
litmus
test
for
United
States’
willingness
to
embrace
trade
-
opening
measures
in
the
face
of
high
unemployment
and
a
stalling
economic
recovery
.

The
China
currency
bill
,
due
for
a
vote
in
the
U.S.
Senate
on
Tuesday
,
is
the
most
telling
measure
and
has
gained
increasing
levels
of
support
.

It
would
require
the
Obama
administration
to
levy
tariffs
on
China
and
four
other
Asian
countries
for
depressing
the
value
of
their
currencies
in
an
effort
to
boost
their
exports
.

Trade
data
due
to
be
released
on
Thursday
could
sharpen
the
debate
even
further
.

The
U.S.
trade
deficit
is
forecast
to
have
worsened
to
$
46
billion
in
August
from
$
44.81
billion
.

China
also
reports
trade
data
for
September
.

Its
exports
are
forecast
to
have
risen
a
robust
20
percent
from
a
year
earlier
,
though
down
from
August
’s
24.5
percent
growth
.

For
some
U.S.
lawmakers
facing
reelection
in
13
months
,
delivering
a
trade
bill
that
penalizes
China
for
using
its
yuan
currency
to
gain
export
share
would
arm
them
with
an
answer
to
voters
questioning
how
they
are
addressing
the
highest
U.S.
unemployment
in
a
quarter
of
century
.

The
unemployment
rate
remains
stuck
at
9.1
percent
for
a
third
straight
month
.

House
Republicans
and
Democrats
have
signed
onto
a
similar
bill
,
and
they
have
sufficient
support
to
override
U.S.
House
Speaker
John
Boehner
and
bring
it
to
a
vote
.

Boehner
like
the
White
House
has
warned
that
the
bill
is
“
pretty
dangerous
”
and
could
lead
to
a
trade
war
with
China
.

While
that
final
showdown
on
the
China
currency
bill
is
not
expected
this
week
,
debate
over
jobs
will
intensify
as
long
-
stalled
Free
Trade
Agreements
with
South
Korea
,
Colombia
and
Panama
come
up
for
votes
on
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
.

Each
side
is
issuing
a
barrage
of
contradictory
estimates
of
job
losses
,
job
creation
and
growth
destruction
.

Disentangling
the
precise
impact
of
free
trade
is
very
difficult
,
given
the
complex
dynamics
of
inter
-
linked
global
economies
where
job
loss
in
one
area
leads
to
growth
in
other
sectors
.

are
tentative
at
best
.

More
important
in
the
trade
votes
,
he
said
,
will
be
the
political
signaling
from
the
world
’s
dominant
power
when
the
global
economy
is
extremely
vulnerable
.

The
U.S.
is
still
the
largest
economy
by
a
wide
margin
and
it
is
still
setting
the
tone
on
international
economic
relations
.

China
is
the
second
largest
economy
.

Deterioration
in
trade
relations
between
the
U.S.
and
China
is
only
going
to
hurt
us
at
a
very
serious
time
,
when
Europe
’s
debt
crisis
could
spin
out
of
control
,
”
he
said
.

Of
the
three
Free
Trade
Agreement
deals
,
the
one
with
South
Korea
appears
to
have
the
strongest
chance
of
passage
.

It
would
prove
a
welcome
gesture
for
South
Korea
President
Lee
Myung
-
Bak
’s
state
visit
to
the
United
States
on
Thursday
.

The
International
Trade
Commission
,
a
U.S.
government
agency
,
estimates
that
the
South
Korea
pact
could
generate
anywhere
from
zero
to
280,000
new
U.S.
jobs
.

The
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
says
it
would
restore
U.S.
market
share
lost
to
the
European
Union
,
which
already
has
reduced
South
Korea
tariffs
.

The
Colombia
free
trade
deal
faces
hurdles
over
concerns
about
the
treatment
of
union
workers
by
Latin
America
’s
fourth
largest
economy
,
though
most
observers
expects
it
will
be
approved
along
with
a
smaller
one
from
Panama
.

Robert
Scott
,
a
trade
economist
at
the
liberal
Economic
Policy
Institute
,
is
more
skeptical
on
passage
of
all
three
.

“
People
have
a
growing
awareness
that
the
trade
system
is
not
working
and
these
deals
are
job
killers
,
”
he
said
.

He
has
estimated
that
the
South
Korea
and
Colombia
deals
would
destroy
214,000
jobs
in
the
seven
years
after
their
implementation
.

Estimates
of
job
creation
only
look
at
the
export
side
of
the
equation
and
omit
the
impact
of
import
substitution
and
foreign
direct
investment
that
leads
to
outsourcing
,
he
said
.

For
those
watching
the
vulnerability
of
global
growth
,
look
for
Britain
’s
industrial
production
on
Tuesday
,
which
is
forecast
to
have
fallen
by
0.2
percent
in
September
for
the
second
month
.

U.S.
retail
sales
for
September
on
Friday
also
will
be
an
important
barometer
.

They
are
forecast
to
have
risen
0.6
percent
after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

In
China
,
growth
has
been
slowing
and
that
may
deliver
Beijing
a
welcome
respite
from
inflation
.

The
consumer
price
index
on
Friday
is
expected
to
ease
slightly
to
6.0
percent
from
6.2
percent
in
August
.

That
would
still
be
well
above
China
’s
annual
target
of
4
percent
,
but
it
would
mark
a
second
consecutive
month
of
declines
from
a
peak
of
6.5
percent
notched
in
July
.

try
to
disperse
hundreds
of
Islamists

were
attacking
them
with
stones

Studies
find
correlation
between
rising
fees
,
problems

*
Investors
should
pay
more
attention
,
say
researchers

Elevated
audit
fees
can
be
a
red
flag
of
problems
to
come
for
a
company
,
say
three
recent
academic
studies
that
together
warn
about
increased
chances
of
fraud
,
stock
price
declines
or
financial
restatements
.

Companies
have
been
disclosing
how
much
they
pay
their
auditors
since
2001
,
when
the
U.S.
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
instituted
the
requirement
as
part
of
a
push
to
improve
corporate
auditor
independence
.

The
numbers
may
be
underappreciated
by
investors
,
however
,
who
seem
not
to
recognize
the
special
insights
auditors
have
.

The
auditors
have
private
information
about
the
firm
because
of
their
interaction
with
management
.

They
obviously
have
a
lot
of
risk
associated
with
any
fraud
at
a
firm
,
and
we
assume
they
adjust
their
fee
accordingly
,
”
said
Ryan
Wilson
,
who
teaches
accounting
at
the
Tippie
College
of
Business
at
the
University
of
Iowa
,
in
an
interview
October
5
.

He
co
-
authored
an
April
2010
study
on
the
topic
.

A
high
or
rising
audit
fee
can
indicate
one
of
two
things
,
experts
say
.

Either
the
auditor
is
charging
a
risk
premium
,
aiming
to
cover
future
legal
costs
to
them
of
something
going
awry
,
or
they
may
just
be
doing
more
work
on
the
audit
,
digging
into
areas
where
results
are
uncertain
.

The
studies’
findings
come
at
a
moment
when
regulators
are
considering
requiring
auditors
to
give
out
even
more
information
.

A
proposal
under
consideration
by
the
U.S.
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight
Board
might
have
auditors
disclosing
more
than
the
current
minimal
thumbs
up
or
down
.

Meantime
,
their
fees
seem
to
be
telling
a
valuable
story
.

Audit
fees
substantially
above
those
paid
by
competitors
and
companies
of
similar
size
are
strongly
associated
with
a
slip
in
operating
performance
the
following
year
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
as
many
as
five
years
later
,
according
to
research
by
Jonathan
Stanley
,
an
accounting
professor
at
Auburn
University
,
published
in
the
current
August
/
October
issue
of
Auditing
,
a
journal
of
the
American
Accounting
Association
.

In
addition
to
forecasting
operating
declines
,
high
audit
fees
are
predictive
of
fraud
and
restatements
,
and
rising
fees
can
foreshadow
steep
stock
price
drops
,
credit
rating
downgrades
and
class
action
lawsuits
,
the
research
has
found
.

American
International
Group
Inc
,
the
insurance
giant
bailed
out
by
the
government
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
in
2008
,
is
one
of
a
number
of
examples
cited
in
interviews
with
the
authors
of
the
studies
.

According
to
SEC
filings
,
AIG
paid
$
66
million
for
its
2004
audit
,
a
$
33
million
increase
over
its
2003
fee
.

In
2005
,
the
company
restated
its
2000
,
2001
,
2002
and
2003
numbers
.

Another
example
is
Swedish
mobile
phone
maker
Ericsson
.

Nicole
Thorne
Jenkins
of
Vanderbilt
University
’s
Owen
Graduate
School
of
Management
said
the
fees
climbed
significantly
faster
than
peers’
the
year
before
it
issued
a
36
percent
profit
decline
in
2007
that
sent
its
stock
down
sharply
.

A
2004
sales
shortfall
at
technology
group
Altera
Corp
was
preceded
by
a
rise
in
its
audit
fee
.

PricewaterhouseCoopers
,
the
auditor
of
all
three
companies
,
declined
to
comment
citing
a
policy
of
not
discussing
client
matters
.

Jenkins
said
in
an
October
5
interview
that
her
research
published
April
2011
found
investors
as
a
group
do
not
recognize
the
importance
of
audit
fees
.

Auburn
’s
Stanley
said
investors
should
consider
audit
fees
with
other
metrics
like
short
interest
and
analysts’
forecasts
,
in
an
October
5
interview
.

There
’s
a
link
between
audit
price
and
future
performance
,
”
he
said
.

Unusually
low
fees
may
be
worth
keeping
an
eye
on
too
,
argued
Donald
Whalen
,
director
of
research
for
Audit
Analytics
,
in
an
October
6
interview
.

If
audit
fees
are
way
down
,
how
can
the
auditor
be
performing
the
necessary
work
?

Whalen
highlighted
the
case
of
government
-
backed
loan
purchaser
Fannie
Mae
.

Auditor
KPMG
charged
the
lender
less
than
$
3
million
a
year
in
2001
,
2002
and
2003
.

When
the
company
changed
auditors
in
2004
,
hiring
Deloitte
&
Touche
,
the
fees
went
up
sharply
to
a
dramatic
$
203
million
in
2004
.

Fees
have
since
dropped
,
but
at
$
37
million
for
the
2010
audit
,

two
”
.

I
think
there
’s
a
level
of
fear
running
through

The

Under

Woodside

nuclear

poorly
perceived
among

admitted
they
knew
little
about

even
though
one
in

concerned
about

The
Australian

has
told
Treasury
in
a
submission
that
a
tax
break
for
bank
deposits
,
which
came
into
force
earlier
this
year
,
was
too
complicated
and
could
create
a
“
compliance

”
for

.

A
50

was
introduced
by

have
argued
that
the
discount
is
not
substantial

encourage

MISRATA
,
Libya
(
Reuters
)
-
Months
of
bombardment
by
Muammar
Gaddafi
’s
forces
,
and
a
central
role
in
the
war
that
ended
his
rule
,
have
bound
the
devastated
Libyan
city
of
Misrata
into
an
extended
military
family
that
runs
on
trust
.

But
as
Misrata
,
a
commercial
hub
whose
notables
opened
their
wallets
to
arm
a
volunteer
force
,
flexes
its
muscle
in
the
new
world
of
Libyan
politics
in
which
gunmen
speak
as
loudly
as
politicians
,
it
is
increasingly
inclined
to
trust
no
one
.

A
collective
memory
of
suffering
,
already
expressed
as
a
grudge
with
the
rest
of
Libya
in
the
scramble
for
political
power
after
Gaddafi
,
has
also
taken
on
a
bitter
edge
at
home
.

Even
local
patriots
now
wonder
about
the
prospects
for
a
peaceful
political
transition
across
the
country
,
if
hometown
solidarity
begins
to
fray
.

“
Misrata
belongs
to
those
who
stood
up
for
us
,
not
those
who
left
when
things
got
tough
,
”
reads
a
slogan
spray
-
painted
on
walls
across
the
city
-
and
the
military
checkpoints
surrounding
it
-
in
reference
those
who
fled
the
shelling
Misrata
endured
after
it
rose
up
against
Gaddafi
in
February
,
and
who
now
seek
to
return
.

The
message
,
some
argue
,
only
reflects
fear
of
the
havoc
a
fifth
column
of
Gaddafi
’s
scattered
loyalists
might
unleash
if
military
vigilance
lapses
as
Misrata
,
along
with
the
rest
of
the
country
,
struggles
to
resume
a
normal
life
.

It
’s
just
because
the
next
city
away
is
Sirte
,

”
says
one
would
-
be
returnee
at
a
checkpoint
outside
Misrata
,
referring
to
Gaddafi
’s
hometown
some
140
km
(
87
miles
)
distant
,
where
Misrata
fighters
are
attempting
to
crush
one
of
the
last
pockets
of
pro
-
Gaddafi
resistance
with
barrages
of
rockets
and
mortars
.

There
has
to
be
some
kind
of
security
procedure
,
because
there
is
still
a
war
,
”
said
that
man
,
who
declined
to
be
identified
as
he
waited
for
gunmen
to
let
him
drive
toward
Misrata
,
accompanied
by
a
resident
in
better
standing
who
would
vouch
for
him
.

Those
who
would
return
need
neighbours
or
members
of
a
sufficiently
respected
military
unit
to
testify
to
their
bona
fides
,
they
say
.

“
We
’re
only
looking
for
people
who
acted
against
Misrata
and
its
population
,
including
people
who
committed
kidnappings
.

They
are
at
large
,
”
says
Mohammed
Abu
Sneina
,
a
commander
with
the
city
’s

Al
-
Hariga
militia
,
which
mans
one
such
checkpoint
at
Dafniyah
,
about
20
km
outside
Misrata
.

When
it
happens
for
routine
cases
,
it
’s
temporary
.

That
routine
vigilance
hints
at
strains
in
a
network
of
good
faith
that
the
city
’s
people
invoke
,
wherever
the
last
stages
of
the
war
against
Gaddafi
brings
them
.

At
tanker
trucks
parked
alongside
the
road
linking
Misrata
to
Sirte
,
gunmen
returning
from
a
day
’s
fighting
fill
their
vehicles
-
often
adorned
with
the
makeshift
rocket
launchers
that
are
the
tools
of
their
war
,
or
loaded
with
objects
,
such
as
equipment
from
the
recently
conquered
Sirte
airport
,
that
are
its
spoils
.

They
register
their
license
plate
numbers
in
ledgers
kept
for
the
Misrata
businessmen
who
send
the
fuel
,
and
also
fund
the
makeshift
rest
stops
which
ply
commuting
gunmen
with
tea
,
tuna
sandwiches
and
packaged
cakes
.

Closer
to
home
,
three
words
recur
in
Misratans’
descriptions
of
themselves
and
their
relations
:
‘
tarabut’
,
or
being
connected
to
one
another
;
‘
tadamon’
,
or
solidarity
;
and
‘
takaatuf’
,
or
standing
shoulder
-
to
-
shoulder
.

Departures
from
those
ideals
leave
some
in
the
city
,
where
empty
shell
casings
that
mark
its
bombardment
have
pride
of
place
in
the
china
cabinets
of
affluent
homes
,
wondering
what
form

unity
will
take
now
.

A
resident
affiliated
with
one
of
the
city
’s
most
celebrated
brigades
recounts
the
experience
of
the
child
of
a
returned
family
ostracized
by
classmates
when
classes
resumed
at
the
local
primary
school
.

This
is
shameful
,
and
it
frightens
me
,
because
it
will
turn
people
against
one
another
,
”
said
this
on
-
again
,
off
-
again
militiaman
.

“
If
Gaddafi
sees
this
,
wherever
he
is
,
he
must
be
laughing
.

The
ominous
shades
in
Misrata
’s
portrait
of
itself
are
visible
in
its
Goushi
district
,
once
populated
in
part
by
black
Libyans
with
roots
in
the
city
of
Tawargha
,
which
lies
about
40
km
south
of
Misrata
.

Tawargha
provided
a
staging
ground
and
some
recruits
for
Gaddafi
’s
campaign
to
crush
the
uprising
against
him
in
Misrata
.

The
city
’s
fighters
recount
a
campaign
of
rape
and
other
atrocities
waged
by
volunteers
from
Tawargha
,
and
circulate
a
Misrata
battle
plan
purportedly
seized
from
the
headquarters
of
a
paramilitary
unit
led
by
one
of
Gaddafi
’s
sons
that
describes
a
role
for
irregulars
from
Tawargha
.

Misrata
’s
fighters
sacked
Tawargha
in
August
.

It
is
now
partly
in
ruins
and
its
former
population
displaced
across
Libya
,
including
Sirte
.

Goushi
itself
appears
emptier
than
much
of
the
rest
of
Misrata
,
if
less
damaged
by
shells
and
rockets
.

Fawzi
Moreiweis
runs
a
local
charity
with
offices
in
the
district
supporting
local
fighters
maimed
in
the
campaign
against
Gaddafi
.

He
echoes
charges
,
leveled
in
the
capital
and
elsewhere
,
that
local
authorities
and
the
ruling
National
Transitional
Council
(
NTC
)
have
betrayed
the
wounded
,
and
waste
or
misuse
funds
to
intended
treat
them
.

NTC
proposals
to
compensate
the
wounded
with
housing
,
and
calls
for
reconciliation
and
self
-
control
from
fighters
-
apparently
sparked
by
criticism
of
attacks
on
Africans
and
dark
-
skinned
Libyans
branded
as
Gaddafi
’s
mercenaries
-
inspire
his
scorn
.

“
They
say
,
do
n’t
mistreat
the
mercenaries
,
these
Nigerians
.

Well
,
you
are
standing
before
heroes
,

”
he
says
,
gesturing
toward
militiamen
who
are
among
the
city
’s
growing
ranks
of
amputees
.

“
This
money
for
housing
should
be
given
to
the
wounded
directly
,
”
he
says
.

One
of
those
fighters
,
Mohammed
Marzouq
,
calls
the
jockeying
for
shares
in
a
transitional
government
,
in
which
representation
of
Misrata
is
emerging
as
a
stumbling
block
,
an
insult
.

“
If
it
was
n’t
for
the
people
who
paid
the
price
with
their
limbs
,
this
revolution
would
never
have
succeeded
,
”
he
says
.

What
right
do
they
have
to
divide
up
seats
?

If
anyone
tries
to
push
Misrata
aside
,
we
will
put
him
aside
.

Fighters
from
the
city
who
set
up
shop
in
the
capital
since
converging
there
with
others
from
across
Libya
to
assault
Gaddafi
’s
compound
in
August
agree
.

They
,
like
Misrata
’s
fighters
on
the
remaining
front
,
roar
laughter
over
a
widely
circulated
recording
that
appears
to
catch
a
respected
Misrata
commander
berating
the
NTC
military
spokesman
,
who
works
from
a
Tripoli
hotel
,
over
his
absence
in
the
field
.

And
like
fighters
from
other
regions
,
notably
the
western
town
of
Zintan
,
they
dismiss
the
head
of
Tripoli
’s
military
council
,
Abdulhakim
Belhadj
,
who
has
called
for
military
units
from
elsewhere
to
pull
their
weapons
from
the
capital
.

Does
he
have
the
experience
and
the
means
to
secure
all
the
ministries
,
embassies
,
vital
institutions
?

”
asked
Adel
al
-
Gallal
,
whose
Jaysh
Misrata
brigade
runs
a
checkpoint
outside
a
landmark
Tripoli
shopping
center
.

That
’s
why
we
’re
here
,
”
he
said
,
a
day
after
fighters
from
Zintan
marched
on
a
position
of
Belhadj
’s
in
the
capital
,
before
turning
back
.

That
incident
came
after
non
-
Tripoli
fighters
distributed
a
derisive
,
mock
-
formal
arrest
warrant
for
Belhadj
that
resembled
wanted
posters
for
fugitive
members
of
Gaddafi
’s
regime
.

Abu
Bakr
Mohammed
,
who
once
built
platforms
for
wedding
ceremonies
,
has
a
twisted
,
raised
scar
from
a
shrapnel
wound
on
his
forehead
to
mark
his
experience
of
the
siege
of
Misrata
.

He
sees
his
presence
in
Tripoli
and
status
as
a
soldier
,
as
necessary
,
but
ultimately
worrisome
.

“
I
’ll
go
back
as
soon
as
things
have
settled
down
.

I
want
a
civil
society
,
not
an
army
existence
,
”
he
says
.

I
want
to
get
married
,
and
I
was
going
to
,
in
April
,
before
all
this
started
.

“
I
’d
never
even
seen
a
gun
,
let
alone
carried
one
around
and
shot
it
.

I
do
n’t
know
how
long
it
’s
good
for
everybody
to
be
doing
this
.

Foreign
companies
are
quietly
returning
to
Libya
’s
oil
fields
east
of
Sirte
,
deploying
skeleton
teams
to
an
area
of
the
hydrocarbon
-
rich
basin
near
the
Jakhira
oasis
,
where
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
barrels
of
crude
per
day
was
pumped
into
pipelines
bound
for
the
coast
before
the
war
.

Germany
’s
Wintershall
is
the
latest
firm
to
have
sent
a
small
group
of
Libyan
workers
to
a
cluster
of
oil
fields
,
where
sites
jointly
operated
by
U.S.
firm
Occidental
Petroleum
Corp
and
Canada
’s

Suncor
Energy
Inc
are
also
in
the
process
of
restarting
.

With
Libya
’s
prized
crude
pumping
through
the
desert
to
the
coastal
terminal
of
Ras
Lanuf
,
workers
say
the
country
’s
largest
refinery
could
restart
within
days
,
with
around
300,000
barrels
of
oil
from
stocks
already
built
up
in
tanks
there
.

Workers
have
been
flown
in
on
cargo
flights
but
many
pilots
are
nervous
to
cross
Libya
’s
skies
that
are
still
subject
to
a
NATO
-
enforced
no
-
fly
zone
.

Yet
,
hopes
are
high
for
a
quick
recovery
.

“
We
are
preparing
to
bring
back
all
employees
,
nothing
here
has
been
damaged
,
”
said
Amal
field
general
manager
Saad
Ali
Eshiem
.

But
fears
of
an
attack
loom
large
and
many
Libyans
are
reluctant
to
leave
the
safety
of
their
hometowns
for
remote
sites
southeast
of
Sirte
,
where
fighting
continues
,
and
few
foreign
workers
have
returned
.

With
sites
operating
with
a
fraction
of
their
pre
-
war
workforces
,
small
teams
onsite
say
output
will
at
best
reach
50
percent
of
total
capacity
without
the
help
of
their
colleagues
.

Oil
flows
will
also
depend
on
the
condition
of
wells
and
pipes
that
have
not
been
used
for
eight
or
nine
months
.

Foreign
companies
contacted
by
Reuters
declined
to
say
when
they
would
redeploy
workers
to
the
fields
near
Jakhira
.

Canada
’s
Suncor
said
last
week
it
was
too
early
to
comment
on
operations
at
its
Amal
field
(
jointly
owned
with
Benghazi
-
based
Agoco
)
while
Occidental
declined
to
comment
on
its
70,000
bpd
Nafoora
field
also
restarting
in
the
area
.

Oil
fields
are
on
high
-
alert
,
and
men
armed
with
AK-47
rifles
continue
to
patrol
sites
day
and
night
,
while
pick
-
up
trucks
mounted
with
machine
guns
patrol
nearby
areas
.

As
fighters
loyal
to
Libya
’s
interim
government
continue
to
battle
for
control
of
central
parts
of
the
country
,
it
could
be
months
before
oil
workers
lower
their
guard
and
the
rest
of
the
work
force
returns
.

And
while
in
other
areas
,
off
-
shore
fields
operated
by
France
’s
Total
and
fields
further
east
operated
by
Italian
oil
and
gas
company
Eni
have
also
restarted
,
Libyan
exports
are
still
only
trickling
back
into
the
world
market
.

North
Africa
’s
fourth
-
largest
producer
exported
1.3
million
bpd
before
the
war
,
and
since
resuming
production
in
September
,
has
sold
only
a
fraction
of
pre
-
war
output
.

On
Friday
,
the
OPEC
member
sold
its
fourth
cargo
of
crude
oil
to
Austrian
energy
group
OMV
and
Swiss
refiner
PetroPlus
.

And
while
firms
have
been
brisk
to
restart
output
at
fields
that
escaped
the
war
relatively
unscathed
,
others
are
already
reported
to
have
suffered
major
damage
and
some
fields
remain
too
dangerous
to
inspect
.

Earlier
this
week
,
Reuters
reported
an
engineer
had
discovered
Eni
’s
largest
oil
field
in
Libya
,
known
as
Elephant
,
lay
in
ruins
,
after
volunteering
to
inspect
the
site
with
a
squad
of
fighters
.

Libyan
transitional
government
forces
seized
the
main
hospital
in
the
city
of
Sirte
on
Sunday
,
a
Reuters
witness
said
,
capturing
more
than
a
dozen
fighters
loyal
to
former
leader
Muammar
Gaddafi
who
had
used
the
buildings
to
launch
mortars
and
rocket
-
propelled
grenades
.

“

Workers
protesting
at
the
headquarters
of
Libya
’s
National
Oil
Company
on
Sunday
said
they
would
strike
until
managers
were
replaced
and
possibly
tried
for
fighting
alongside
Gaddafi
.

Most
of
the
crowd
worked
for
Waha
Oil
,
a
joint
venture
with
American
firms
ConocoPhillips
,
Marathon
and
Amerada
Hess
.

Documents
proving
managers
had
used
the
Waha
Oil
complex
as
a
base
for
Gaddafi
fighters
had
been
presented
to
the
NOC
chairman
that
morning
,
protesters
said
.

The
oil
fields
had
been
targeted
by
NATO
because
they
were
used
to
feed
,
shelter
and
equip
loyalist
fighters
,
according
to
the
workers
,
who
said
it
could
take
four
to
six
months
to
restart
flows
.

“
There
is
a
lot
of
damage
at
the
fields
...
especially
at
Gialo
and
Waha
,
”
said
Ahmed
Zahmun
,
a
Waha
Oil
protester
.

In
an
interview
last
week
,
the
NOC
’s
chairman
told
Reuters
that
NATO
airstrikes
on
Libyan
oil
fields
had
been
executed
with
“
surgical
precision
.

A
source
at
NOC
confirmed
Nouri
Berouin
,
the
chairman
,
had
met
Waha
Oil
workers
on
Sunday
,
but
added
requests
to
remove
directors
had
not
been
heeded
.

Other
North
American
firms
in
Libya
are
facing
contrasting
fortunes
,
with
Occidental
and
Suncor
both
restarting
production
at
fields
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
Sirte
basin
this
week
.

European
companies
,
including
German
,
Italian
and
French
oil
firms
,
have
also
succeeded
in
pumping
oil
for
the
first
time
since
war
broke
out
,
but
they
have
met
with
mixed
fates
as
well
.

Last
week
an
operations
manager
at
Eni
’s
headquarters
in
Tripoli
told
Reuters
the
Italian
oil
and
gas
company
’s
largest
oilfield
,
Elephant
,
lay
in
ruins
and
would
not
restart
until
2012
.

Eni
’s
CEO
later
said
the
company
did
not
know
of
any
damage
to
the
field
.

So
far
,
oil
has
yet
to
flow
from
the
West
and
parts
of
Libya
’s
oil
-
rich
basin
remain
too
dangerous
to
inspect
.

Waha
Oil
pumped
just
under
400,000
barrels
of
oil
per
day
(
bpd
)
before
the
war
,
but
is
now
producing
no
crude
and
field
workers
say
they
will
not
return
until
managers
were
replaced
.

Protesters
said
Libyans
had
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
get
a
good
job
throughout
Gaddafi
’s
rule
and
wanted
a
better
future
.

“
After
more
than
40
years
,
we
are
still
relying
on
foreign
workers
.

Libyans
have
no
chance
to
get
a
good
position
.

There
is
no
future
strategy
,
”
said
Ahmed
Zahmoul
.

Sunday
’s
protest
followed
a
similar
demonstration
last
week
at
Waha
Oil
’s
headquarters
.

Engineers
there
reported
damage
was
severe
in
parts
of
the
complex
,
while
some
oil
fields
were
still
unsafe
to
visit
.

Waha
Oil
workers
were
joined
by
employees
at
the
Libyan
Petroleum
Institute
,
who
also
said
their
managers
had
actively
supported
Gaddafi
’s
army
.

The
army
came
there
for
rifles
and
machine
guns
,
”
said
Ibrahim
Twebti
,
an
employee
at
the
institute
.

Punishment
was
up
to
the
Libyan
court
charged
with
processing
Gaddafi
loyalists
,
protesters
said
,
but
whatever
the
result
,
managers
were
unqualified
for
their
jobs
and
should
not
be
allowed
to
stay
on
.

We
want
to
change
that
,
”
said
Hatem
Wafa
,
a
geophysicist
at
the
protest
.

the

of

battling

and
enjoying
some
of
the
luxury
that
was
formerly

say
the

,
with
its

halls
,
meeting
rooms
,
restaurants
and

,
was
meant
to
house
Gaddafi
’s

.

“
It
was
built
for
the

.

Normal

Sirte
hotel
is
similar
to
many
other
opulent
five
-
star
hotels
in
other
oil
-
rich
Arab
countries
,
but
stands
in
contrast
with
the
run
-
down
hotels
in
Libya
’s
second
-
biggest
city
of
Benghazi
in
the
east
.

Many
Libyans
resent
Gaddafi
and
his
family
for
their
lavish
lifestyle
and
say
residents
of
Tripoli
and
Sirte
are
wealthier
than
the
rest
of
the
country
.

In
Benghazi
,
people
blame
years
of
decay
,
neglect
and
isolation
—
symbolized
by
the
city
’s
crumbling
buildings
,
broken
roads
and
narrow
rubbish
-
strewn
alleys
and
swarms
of
flies
—
on
Gaddafi
’s
one
-
man
-
rule
.

They
say
Gaddafi
took
better
care
of
the
capital
Tripoli
and
Sirte
,
his
hometown
and
the
bastion
of
his
tribe
,
al
-
Gaddafa
,
because
the
once
“
Brother
Leader
”
feared
Benghazi
’s
rebellious
nature
would
threaten
his
rule
.

“
It
is
the
first
time
in
our
lives
that
we
see
something
like
this
hotel
and
now
we
are
staying
in
it
with
our
weapons
,
”
said
NTC
fighter
Osama
Rajab
Najem
,
from
Benghazi
.

“
They
used
to
search
us
every
time
we
would
come
to
the
gates
of
Sirte
.

Sometimes
they
would
know
by
our
dialect
that
we
were
from
Benghazi
.
”

Now
they
say
they
will
rebuild
Sirte
,
which
has
been
under
heavy
bombardment
by
NTC
and
NATO
forces
over
the
past
weeks
.

Smoke
rises
above
the
city
and
many
of
its
buildings
and
infrastructure
are
now
in
ruins
.

In
one
example
,
NTC
fighters
have
blown
up
a
green
concrete
gate
,
50
km
from
Sirte
,
but
the
blast
did
not
completely
demolish
the
gate
,
seen
as
a
symbol
of
Gaddafi
’s
rule
.

Fighters
then
showered
it
with
bullets
.

The
names
of
their
dead
are
written
on
the
remaining
concrete
.

We
do
n’t
want
anything
that
reminds
us
of
Muammar
,
”
said
one
of
the
rebels
manning
the
checkpoint
into
the
city
.

By
the
time
we
enter
Sirte
,
there
will
be
no
Sirte
,
”
another
NTC
fighter
said
on
the
frontline
a
few
kilometers
away
from
the
city
center
,
as
tanks
and
artillery
fired
at
buildings
where
Gaddafi
loyalists
are
thought
to
be
hiding
.

As
he
surveyed
the
damage
,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
added
:
“
We
will
rebuild
Sirte
.

The

.

The
46-year

Assad
,
who
inherited
power
from
his
father
in
2000
,
blames
the
violence
on
armed
gangs
backed
by
foreign

,
while
his
officials
say
700
police
and
soldiers
have
been
killed
,
as
well
as

The
authorities
have
dismissed
the

Ghalioun
said

it

the

“

,
”
Foreign
Minister
Walid
al
-
Moualem
told
a
news
conference
broadcast
by
Syrian
television
.

The
formation
of
the
council
has
been
welcomed
by
Western
countries
including
the
United
States
and
France
.

However
,
unlike
the
transitional
council
set
up
by
Libyan
rebels
who
overthrew
Muammar
Gaddafi
,
they
have
not
offered
it
any
formal
recognition
.

The
United
Nations
says
2,900
people
have
been
killed
in
Assad
’s
crackdown
on
six
months
of
mainly
peaceful
protests
.

On
Saturday
,
activists
said
security
forces
killed
at
least
two
people
when
they
opened
fire
on
tens
of
thousands
of
mourners
at
the
funeral
of
a
Kurdish
opposition
figure
.

Moualem
described
Mishaal
al
-
Tammo
as
a
martyr
killed
by
terrorists
,
suggesting
he
was
targeted
because
he
opposed
foreign
intervention
in
Syria
.

Tammo
’s
family
have
blamed
Syrian
authorities
for
his
death
.

Moualem
also
criticized
European
countries
where
he
said
Syrian
embassies
had
been
attacked
by
protesters
,
saying
that
if
they
did
not
meet
their
obligations
to
protect
foreign
missions
Syria
would
respond
in
similar
fashion
.

He
was
speaking
at
a
joint
news
conference
with
ministers
from
five
Latin
American
countries
,
who
were
visiting
Syria
to
show
support
for
Assad
’s
government
.

It
was
n't
exactly
a
knockout
,
but
DreamWorks
'
robot

boxing
movie
"
Real
Steel
"
packed
enough
punch
to
win
the
domestic
box
office
this
weekend
with
$
27.3
million
.

The
opening
at
3,440
locations
for
the
Shawn
Levy
-
directed
film
was
in
line
with
most
pre
-
release
expectations
—
but
perhaps
a
little
light
for
a
movie
that
cost
more
than
$
110
million
to
make
.

The
film
also
grossed
$
22.1
million

Idealism
Gets
Assassinated
in
Clooney
's
'
Ides
of

'

The
European
Union
said
on
Sunday
it
plans
to
invite
Israeli
and
Palestinian
representatives
to
meet
“
in
the
coming
days
”
to
discuss
resuming
peace
negotiations
.

But
it
was
not
immediately
clear
whether
such
an
invitation
could
resolve
a
year
-
long
impasse
in
diplomacy
,
as
spokesmen
for
both
Israel
and
the
Palestinians
responded
by
restating
long
-
held
positions
already
blamed
for
perpetuating
the
stalemate
.

The
announcement
by
Catherine
Ashton
,
High
Representative
of
the
Union
for
Foreign
Affairs
and
Security
Policy
,
was
made
after
a
meeting
of
the
Middle
East
Quartet
—

the
EU
,
the
United
States
,
Russia
and
the
United
Nations
.

The
Quartet
discussed
what
to
do
next
to
encourage
the
two
sides
to
resume
“
substantive
”
negotiations
as
soon
as
possible
.

Palestinian
President
Mahmoud
Abbas
has
demanded
that
Israel
halt
all
settlement
building
in
the
occupied
West
Bank
before
Palestinians
will
restart
talks
.

Israel
has
made
clear
it
is
not
ready
to
suspend
settlement
expansion
beyond
a
10-month
hiatus
it
implemented
a
year
ago
,
an
issue
over
which
U.S
.-
sponsored
negotiations
between
the
sides
have
remained
frozen
since
September
2010
.

Last
month
,
Abbas
formally
asked
the
United
Nations
to
recognize
a
Palestinian
state
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
Strip
,
a
move
opposed
by
Israel
and
the
United
States
.

They
say
only
a
negotiated
peace
can
end
the
Middle
East
conflict
and
create
a
Palestinian
state
alongside
Israel
.

In
response
to
Ashton
’s
statement
,
Nabil
Abu
Rdainah
,
a
spokesman
for
Abbas
,
said
that
if
Israel
“
recognizes
the
1967
borders
and
freezes
settlements
,
we
are
ready
to
go
immediately
”
to
talks
the
EU
seeks
to
convene
.

In
Jerusalem
,
an
Israeli
official
contacted
by
Reuters

for
the
third
time
on
Sunday
,
exchanging
vows
with
American
heiress
Nancy
Shevell
at
the
same
London
register
office
where
the
former
Beatle
we
d
his
first
wife
Linda
in
1969
.

The
beaming
couple
emerged
from
the
grey
-
stone
Old
Marylebone
Town
Hall
to
confetti
and
cheers
from
dozens
of
fans
who
had
waited
hours
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
music
legend
and
his
new
wife
.

Brunette
Shevell
,
51
,
wore
a
knee
-
length
,
long
-
sleeved
white
dress
which
reports
said
was
designed
by
McCartney
’s
fashion
designer
daughter
Stella
.

The
bride
also
had
a
white
flower
in
her
hair
and
carried
a
small
posy
of
roses
,
while
“

Hey
Jude
”
singer
McCartney
wore
a
dark
suit
and
light
blue
tie
.

One
newspaper
had
a
headline
saying
:

“
Yes
-
today
”
,
in
a
reference
to
the
famous
Beatles
song
.

Despite
his
huge
wealth
as
a
key
songwriter
and
frontman
for
the
world
’s
most
successful
pop
band
,
69-year
-
old
McCartney
chose
a
modest
civil
ceremony
before
a
small
group
of
family
and
friends
.

Ringo
Starr
,
the
only
other
surviving
member
of
the
“
Fab
Four
”
,
and
his
wife
Barbara
Bach
were
among
the
guests
at
the
wedding
.

Ex
-
Beatle
John
Lennon
,
who
was
assassinated
in
New
York
in
1980
,
would
have
been
71
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
.

After
the
ceremony
,
which
lasted
just
over
an
hour
,
the
newlyweds
returned
to
McCartney
’s
home
in
St.
John
’s
Wood
for
an
evening
reception
.

The
property
in
the
upmarket
area
of
north
London
is
just
a
few
streets
away
from
the
Abbey
Road

Studios
where
the
Beatles
recorded
many
of
their
most
famous
songs
.

Asked
how
he
felt
after
marrying
for
a
third
time
,
he
told
reporters
:
“
Terrific
,
thank
you
.

Rock’n’roll
royalty
including
Starr
,
Rolling
Stone
Ronnie
Wood
and
guitarist
Jeff
Beck
attended
the
reception
,
as
did
model
Twiggy
and
artist
Tracey
Emin
.

Late
Beatle
George
Harrison
’s
widow
Olivia
turned
up
to
the
soiree
,
which
was
also
designed
to
be
a
low
-
key
affair
.

McCartney
’s
spokesman
declined
to
divulge
any
details
of
the
wedding
day
,
but
celebrity
-
hungry
tabloids
in
Britain
,
where
the
affectionately
named
“
Macca
”
is
hugely
popular
,
have
been
poring
over
every
detail
.

According
to
reports
,
McCartney
composed
a
song
for
Shevell
especially
for
their
big
day
.

He
was
also
expected
to
perform
“
Let
it
Be
”
,
which
he
sang
to
Shevell
on
one
of
their
first
holidays
together
three
years
ago
,
and
her
favorite
“

McCartney
was
married
for
29
years
to
American
photographer
Linda
until
her
death
from
breast
cancer
in
1998
.

He
said
at
the
time
that
he
and
Linda
had
spent
just
11
nights
apart
during
their
marriage
.

McCartney
’s
marriage
to
former
model
and
charity
campaigner

The
couple
wedded
in
2002
in
a
lavish
ceremony
at
Castle
Leslie
in
Ireland
estimated
by
celebrity
magazines
to
have
cost
around
$
3.2
million
.

But
four
years
later
they
confirmed
they
had
separated
,
blaming
media
intrusion
into
their
private
lives
,
and
in
2008
the
couple
divorced
.

A
judge
had
to
rule
on
the
size
of
the
divorce
settlement
after
the
couple
failed
to
reach
agreement
themselves
,
and
Mills
was
awarded
24.3
million
pounds
(
$
38
million
)
,
ending
one
of
the
most
acrimonious
breakups
in
showbusiness
history
.

She
had
claimed
125
million
pounds
and
said
McCartney
was
worth
800
million
pounds
,
although
a
judge
found
his
fortune
was
worth
half
that
amount
.

McCartney
has
a
son
,
two
daughters
and
a
stepdaughter
from
his
marriage
to
Linda
,
and
a
daughter
from
his
marriage
to
Mills
.

The
independently

wealthy
Shevell

who
was
married
to
an
attorney
for
more
than
20
years
and
serves
on

LONDON

(

-
China
Guangdong
Nuclear
Power
Corp
(
CGNPC
)
is
expected
to
relaunch
its
270
pence
a
share
offer
for
uranium
miner
Kalahari
Minerals
following
a
three
-
month
block
imposed
by
UK
regulators
.

An
announcement
could
come
as
soon
as
next
week
,
”
a
source
familiar
with
the
situation
told
Reuters
,
adding
that
the
deal

is
expected
to
be
on
the
same
terms
as
an
earlier
270-pence
per
share
offer
.

State
-
owned
CGNPC
was
in
talks
in
March
to
buy
Kalahari
for
290
pence
a
share
.

In
the
days
following
the
earthquake
and
nuclear
disaster
in
Japan
,
the
companies
agreed
CGNPC
could
cut
the
price
to
270
pence
,
but
they
failed
to
persuade
UK
regulators
and
CGNPC
was
forced
to
withdraw
its
informal
bid
.

A
270
pence
bid
would
value
AIM
-
listed
Kalahari
at
just
over
650
million
pounds
(
$
1
billion
)
and
would
represent
a
14-percent
premium
to
the
current
236.3
pence
share
price
.

Kalahari
shares
had
closed
at
226p
the
day
before
CGNPC
withdrew
its
offer
on
May
11
.

Kalahari
holds
a
43-percent
stake
in
Extract
Resources

,
owner
of
the
Husab
project
in
Namibia
,
which
is
potentially
the
second
-
largest
uranium
mine
in
the
world
.

Kalahari
had
not
demanded
payment
of
a
7.5
million
pound
break
fee
from
its
Chinese
suitors
after
CGNPC
was
forced
to
drop
its
earlier
offer
,
leaving
the
door
open
for
a
future
move
.

The
UK
Takeover
Panel
ruled
in
May
that
CGNPC
could
not
announce
a
firm
offer
at
270
pence
per
share
,
even
with
the
agreement
of
the
Kalahari
board
,
and
would
have
to
wait
three
months
if
it
wanted
to
return
with
an
offer
lower
than
the
original
290
pence
a
share
proposal
.

Opportunistic
M&A
deals
are
expected
to
pick
up
in
the
sector
as
current
valuation
levels
for
miners
are
edging
closer
to
lows
hit
during
the
2008
crisis

making

targets
cheap
for
cashed

up
buyers

Minors
in
the
state
of
California
will
no
longer
be
allowed
to
use
tanning
beds
after
Governor
Jerry
Brown
signed
a
bill
on
Sunday
prohibiting
anyone
under
the
age
of
18
from
using
ultraviolet
tanning
devices
.

California
is
the
first
state
in
the
nation
to
ban
minors
from
using
tanning
beds
,
legislators
said
.

Previously
,
California
had
banned
minors
under
the
age
of
14
from
using
tanning
beds
,
but
allowed
those
between
14
and
18
years
of
age
to
use
tanning
beds
with
parental
consent
.

The
bill
was
part
of
a
cluster
of
legislation
signed
on
Sunday
designed
to
“
improve
the
health
and
well
-
being
of
Calfornians
,
”
according
to
a
statement
from
the
Governor
’s
office
.

I
praise
Gov.
Brown
for
his
courage
in
taking
this
much
-
needed
step
to
protect
some
of
California
’s
most
vulnerable
residents
—
our
kids
—
from
what
the
‘
House
of
Medicine’
has
conclusively
shown
is
lethally
dangerous
:
ultraviolet
-
emitting
radiation
from
tanning
beds
,
”
the
bill
’s
sponsor
,
state
Senator
Ted
Lieu
,
said
in
a
statement
.

“
If
everyone
knew
the
true
dangers
of
tanning
beds
,
they
’d
be
shocked
.

Skin
cancer
is
a
rising
epidemic
and
the
leading
cause
of
cancer
death
for
women
between
25
and
29
.
”

The
law
will
go
into
effect
on
January
1
,
2012
,
according
to
Lieu
’s
office
.

Syria
threatened
Sunday
to
retaliate
against
any
country
that
formally
recognizes
a
recently
established
opposition
National
Council
which
is
seeking
international
support
for
the
six
-
month
-
old
uprising
against
President
Bashar
al
-
Assad
.

The
formation
of
the
council
has
been
welcomed
by
Assad
’s
Western
critics
,
including
the
United
States
and
France
,
however
they
have
not
embraced
it
diplomatically
as
they
did
the
Libyan
rebels
who
overthrew
Muammar
Gaddafi
.

“
We
will
take
tough
measures
against
any
state
which
recognizes
this
illegitimate
council
,
”
Foreign
Minister
Walid
al
-
Moualem
told
a
news
conference
in
Damascus
.

Speaking
alongside
a
group
of
Latin
American
ministers
who
visited
Syria
to
show
support
for
Assad
,
Moualem
also
dismissed
Turkish
criticism
of
Assad
’s
crackdown
and
said
no
one
should
think
the
West
would
launch
military
action
against
Syria
.

The
West
will
not
attack
Syria
because
no
one
will
pay
the
bill
,
”
he
said
.

The
West
chose
economic
sanctions
to
starve
our
people
,
under
the
pretext
of
protecting
human
rights
.
”

The
United
Nations
says
2,900
people
have
been
killed
in
Assad
’s
crackdown
on
mainly
peaceful
protests
.

The
Syrian
leadership
blames
armed
groups
backed
by
foreign
powers
for
the
violence
,
saying
1,100
members
of
the
security
forces
have
been
killed
since
the
unrest
broke
out
in
March
.

Activists
reported
clashes
across
the
country
Sunday
,
from
Jabal
al
-
Zawiyah
near
the
northern
border
with
Turkey
to
the
southern
province
of
Deraa
.

The
Syrian
Observatory
for
Human
rights
said
seven
people
were
killed
in
shooting
in
the
central
city
of
Homs
,
adding
that
by
late
evening
communications
to
the
city
were
cut
after
the
sound
of
explosions
were
heard
.

Three
people
were
also
killed
in
rural
areas
around
the
city
of
Hama
during
fighting
between
troops
and
gunmen
believed
to
be
army
defectors
,
the
British
-
based
organization
said
.

It
said
there
were
also
fatalities
in
clashes
between
the
army
and
suspected
defectors
in
Jabal
al
-
Zawiyah
and
in
Dael
,
in
Deraa
province
,
but
gave
no
death
tolls
for
those
clashes
.

In
the
town
of
Dumeir
,
40
km
(
25
miles
)
northeast
of
Damascus
,
the
Observatory
said
security
forces
killed
three
people
Sunday
when
they
opened
fire
on
the
funeral
procession
of
a
youth
whose
body
was
returned
after
he
died
in
captivity
.

The
grassroots
Local
Coordination
Committees
group
put
Sunday
’s
death
toll
at
17
.

Foreign
media
are
largely
barred
from
entering
Syria
and
it
was
not
possible
to
confirm
the
reports
independently
.

Saturday
,
activists
said
security
forces
killed
at
least
two
people
when
they
shot
at
tens
of
thousands
of
mourners
at
the
funeral
of
a
Kurdish
opposition
figure
.

Moualem
described
Mishaal
al
-
Tammo
as
a
martyr
killed
by
terrorists
,
suggesting
he
was
targeted
because
he
opposed
foreign
intervention
in
Syria
.

Tammo
’s
family
have
blamed
Syrian
authorities
for
his
death
.

Turkey
condemned
Tammo
’s
“
heinous
assassination
”
and
also
criticised
the
reported
assault
on
another
prominent
opposition
figure
,
former
parliamentarian
Riad
Seif
,
appearing
to
blame
Syrian
authorities
for
both
attacks
.

“
Turkey
expects
the
Syrian
administration
to
realize
as
soon
as
possible
that
the
acts
of
violence
designed
to
suppress
the
opposition
in
Syria
...
can
not
turn
back
the
course
of
history
,
”
a
foreign
ministry
statement
said
.

Once
a
close
ally
of
Assad
’s
,
Turkey
has
hosted
several
meetings
of
the
opposition
National
Council
.

It
has
also
given
shelter
to
thousands
of
Syrian
refugees
,
as
well
as
the
most
senior
Syrian
army
officer
to
defect
from
Assad
’s
military
.

CNN
Turk
channel
said
Sunday
Syrian
police
were
stopping
Turkish
citizens
from
entering
Syria
at
the
border
town
of
Nusaybin
,
a
few
miles
(
km
)
north
of
Qamishli
where
Tammo
was
killed
,
because
of
increased
tensions
in
the
area
.

Prime
Minister
Tayyip
Erdogan
has
said
he
plans
to
impose
sanctions
on
Syria
and
has
launched
military
exercises
in
Hatay
province
,
where
Syria
has
a
longstanding
territorial
claim
.

“
Syria
’s
hands
are
not
tied
,
”
Moualem
responded
.

Whoever
throws
a
rose
at
it
,
it
will
throw
a
rose
back
.
”

The
official
SANA
news
agency
said
Assad
told
the
ministers
from
Venezuela
,
Cuba
,
Bolivia
,
Ecuador
and
Nicaragua
,
part
of
a
group
at
odds
with
the
United
States
,
that
Syria
was
focusing
on
“
political
reform
...
and
ending
the
phenomenon
of
armed
(
groups
)
.

In
response
to
the
protests
,
Assad
has
formally
ended
nearly
50
years
of
emergency
rule
and
pledged
multi
-
party
parliamentary
elections
next
year
,
but
opponents
say
the
moves
are
meaningless
while
security
forces
continue
to
kill
protesters
.

Diplomats
and
analysts
say
the
protests
have
been
largely
peaceful
but
there
have
been
a
steady
flow
of
army
defections
and
increasing
reports
of
armed
clashes
with
security
forces
.

“
Many
in
the
West
say
this
is
a
peaceful
revolution
and

(
these
are
)
peaceful
demonstrations
,
”
Moualem
said
.

They
do
not
acknowledge
the
presence
of
armed
terrorist
groups
,
(
but
)
they
finance
them
and
smuggle
weapons
to
them
.
”

Bourhan
Ghalioun
,
chairman
of
the
opposition
National
Council
,
said
in
Sweden
Saturday
the
organization
was
seeking
Assad
’s
removal
by
peaceful
methods
and
called
on
global
powers
to
do
more
to
help
achieve
this
goal
.

“
We
demand
that
the
international
community
assume
its
responsibilities
and
find
ways
to
help
protect
Syrian
civilians
,
”
he
said
,
sharply
criticising
Russia
for
helping
block
a
U.N.
Security
Council
resolution
on
Syria

Rio
Tinto
has
told
Zimbabwe
’s
government
it
will
give
up
a
51
percent
stake
in
its
local
diamond
unit
Murowa
,
state
media
reported
on
Saturday
,
making
it
the
first
foreign
-
owned
firm
to
voluntarily
comply
with
the
country
’s
local
ownership
law
.

“
Murowa
Diamonds
wrote
to
us
(
on
Thursday
)
saying
they
have
given
up
51
percent
of
shares
and
these
would
be
given
to
our
people
,
”
Kasukuwere
told
the
official
Herald
newspaper
.

Murowa
officials
were
not
available
for
comment
.

The
heavily
criticised
law
is
aimed
mainly
at
mining
firms
and
banks
operating
in
the
resource
-
rich
country
,
which
has
become
an
economic
basket
case
because
of
what
analysts
say
are
years
of
mismanagement
by
President
Robert
Mugabe
’s
government
.

Last
month
,
Indigenisation
and
Empowerment
Minister
Saviour
Kasukuwere
said
mining
firms
had
mostly
met
a
September
deadline
by
which
they
were
required
to
submit
plans
to
transfer
a
51
percent
stake
in
their
operations
to
locals
.

The
world
’s
number
one
and
two
platinum
producers
,
Anglo
American
Platinum
and
Impala
Platinum
are
also
major
foreign
mining
firms
with
assets
in
Zimbabwe
.

Critics
have
said
a
major
reason
for
the
law
is
to
allow
Mugabe
’s
ZANU
-
PF
party
to
build
up
a
war
chest
ahead
of
national
elections
that
could
come
as
early
as
next
year
.

They
say
Zimbabwe
,
emerging
from
a
decade
-
long
slump
,
can
not
raise
the
funds
needed
to
take
over
the
mining
assets
and
the
cash
generated
by
the
firms
would
go
to
top
officials
,
not
ordinary
people
,
who
rank
among
the
poorest
in
the
world
.

Regulations
supporting
the
empowerment
law
require
miners

to
choose
local
partners
from
a
government
approved
list
,
which
Prime
Minister
Morgan
Tsvangirai
’s
Movement
for
Democratic
Change
(
MDC
)
party
says
is
meant
to
benefit
Mugabe
’s
allies
.

Mugabe
was
forced
to
share
power
with
Tsvangirai
two
years
ago
after
disputed
elections
in
2008
.

The
two
have
sharp
differences
over
the
ownership
policy
.

My
overall
assessment
is
that
over
90
percent
of
the
submitted
proposals
do
not
meet
the
minimum
requirements
(
of
choosing
partners
from
a
government
list
)
and
there
seems
to
be
an
element
of
resistance
,
”
Kasukuwere
was
quoted
as
saying
.

Kasukuwere
also
said
plans
submitted
by
foreign
mines
generally
show
the
companies
want
to
sell
a
maximum
of
30
percent
of
shares
while
the
remaining
21
percent
would
be
made
up
of
empowerment
credits
awarded
for
social
investments
made
in
infrastructure
,
health
and
education
facilities
.

Implats
unit
Zimplats
,
which
is
the
largest
platinum
producer
in
Zimbabwe
was
given
up
to
next
month
to
fully
comply
with
the
empowerment
law
.

Zimbabwe
has
the
world
’s
second
-
largest
known
platinum
reserves
after
neighbouring
South
Africa
and
market
watchers
and
investors
are
therefore
keen
to
see
how
the
situation
unfolds
against
the
backdrop
of
red
-
hot
commodity
prices
.

WARSAW
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Polish
voters
handed
Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
’s
centre
-
right
Civic
Platform
four
more
years
in
power
on
Sunday
,
exit
polls
showed
,
paving
the
way
for
him
to
pursue
cautious
economic
reforms
and
closer
ties
with
the
rest
of
the
EU
.

An
exit
poll
showed
Tusk
’s
pro
-
business
party
was
on
course
to
win
39.6
percent
of
votes
in
a
parliamentary
election
,
short
of
an
absolute
majority
but
far
ahead
of
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
nationalist
-
conservative
Law
and
Justice
party
on
30.1
percent
.

It
is
the
first
time
a
ruling
party
has
been
re
-
elected
in
the
country
of
38
million
since
the
fall
of
communism
in
1989
.

Financial
markets
are
expected
to
welcome
the
result
,
which
points
to
four
more
years
of
relative
political
and
economic
stability
in
the
European
Union
’s
largest
eastern
member
state
at
a
time
of
deepening
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
.

“
I
wanted
to
thank
all
of
those
who
voted
for
us
and
those
who
did
n’t
because
we
will
be
together
bearing
responsibility
for
Poland
for
four
more
years
,

”
Tusk
,
54
,
said
in
a
victory
speech
to
cheers
at
his
party
’s
headquarters
.

Kaczynski
conceded
defeat
and
the
Peasants’
Party
,
Tusk
’s

junior
coalition
partner
for
the
past
four
years
,
said
it
was
ready
to
renew
the
alliance
.

Projections
based
on
the
exit
poll
,
conducted
by
TNS
OBOP
for
national
television
,
showed
the
two
parties
would
have
enough
seats
to
secure
a
majority
in
the
Sejm
or
lower
house
.

Polish
President
Bronislaw
Komorowski
,
a
former
Civic
Platform
lawmaker
,
is
now
expected
to
ask
Tusk
to
form
a
government

but
he
said
he
must
first
wait
for
the
official
election
results
,
expected
on
Tuesday
evening
.

“
I
hope
that
it
will
be
possible
to
reduce
the
time
necessary
for
creating
the
government
...
to
a
minimum
,
”
he
said
.

Poland
was
the
only
EU
member
state
not
to
sink
into
recession
during
the
2008
-
09
global
economic
crisis
.

This
is
a
vote
for
stability
more
than
anything
else
,
”
said
Nicholas
Spiro
,
head
of
Spiro
Sovereign
Strategy
,
a
London
-
based
consultancy
.

“
From
a
market
standpoint
,
one
of
the
key
anchors
of
Poland
’s
creditworthiness
has
remained
in
place
.

Given
the
rapidly
deteriorating
external
backdrop
,
there
is
an
even
bigger
premium
on
political
stability
in
Poland
.
”

But
he
also
cautioned
that
Civil
Platform
’s
preference
for
caution
left
questions
over
whether
the
next
government
would
carry
out
the
kind
of
fiscal
and
structural
reforms
that
Poland
needs
.

Finance
Minister
Jacek
Rostowski
said
he
was
ready
to
remain
in
his
post
and
reiterated
his
intention
to
reduce
Poland
’s
budget
deficit
to
below
3
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
next
year
,
in
line
with
promises
to
the
EU
.

Civic
Platform
has
also
vowed
to
press
on
with
a
privatisation
programme
expected
to
bring
in
15
billion
zlotys

(
$
4.6
billion
)
this
year
and
10
billion
zlotys
in
2012
.

An
aide
to
Tusk
said
the
prime
minister
would
continue
his
policy
of
gradual
economic
reforms
.

At
a
time
of
global
crisis
,
such
turmoil
on
the
global
markets
,
even
gradual
reforms
will
require
brave
decisions
and
our
coalition
will
continue
to
do
them
effectively
,
”
said
the
aide
,
Michal
Boni
.

The
post
-
communist
Democratic
Left
Alliance
won
7.7
percent
—
a
surprisingly
poor
result
—
the
rural
-
based
Peasants’
Party
8.2
percent
,
and
a
new
liberal
grouping
called
Palikot
’s
Movement
10.1
percent
,
the
exit
poll
showed
.

Projected
results
based
on
the
exit
poll
showed
Civic
Platform
and
the
Peasants’
Party
should
have
239
seats
in
the
450-seat
Sejm
.

The
result
is
a
personal
triumph
for
Tusk
,
a
pragmatic
liberal
conservative
from
near
Gdansk
on
Poland
’s

Baltic
coast
who
was
involved
in
the
Solidarity
movement
that
helped
end
decades
of
communist
rule
.

Tusk

percent
of
gross
national
product
(
GDP
)
this
year
,
and
to
rein
in
public
debt
,
seen
at
53.8
percent
of
GDP
,
or
face
the
risk
of
Poland
being
downgraded
by
ratings
agencies
.

Tusk
also
favours
closer
integration
with
the
rest
of
the
EU
and
says
joining
the
euro
remains
a
strategic
goal
for
Poland
despite
the
debt
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
.

Kaczynski
’s
calls
for
a
halt
to
privatisation
,
for
higher
taxes
on
the
wealthy
and
for
a
more
combative
stance
in
dealings
with
Poland
’s
EU
partners
had
unsettled
investors
.

A
government
led
by
Kaczynski
,
62
,
would
have
been
likely
to
strain
Poland
’s
relations
with
its
two
large
neighbours
,
Russia
and
Germany
,
as
happened
when
law
and
Justice

was
last
in
power
from

2005
to
2007
.

Kaczynski
distrusts
both
Berlin
and
Moscow

Poland
was
carved
up
under
a
Nazi
-
Soviet
pact
before
World
War
Two
—
and
raised
eyebrows
during
the
election
campaign
by
repeating
in
a
new
book
his
view
that
Berlin
is
trying
to
subdue
Poland
.

Tusk
has
good
personal
ties
with
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
has
maintained
a
cautious
rapprochement
with
Moscow
,
despite
strains
over
a
plane
crash
last
year
that
killed
then
-
President
Lech
Kaczynski
,
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
twin
.

An
unapologetic
Pastor
Robert
Jeffress
,
who
created
a
stir
for
calling
Mormonism
a
“
cult
”
at
a
political
gathering
,
told
hundreds
of
congregants
at
his
Texas
megachurch
on
Sunday
that
he
welcomed
the
opportunity
he
’s
had
to
warn
people
about
a
“
false
religion
.
”

I
have
not
changed
my
position
,
”
Jeffress
told
the
crowd
of
about
2,000
attending
the
early
service
at
First
Baptist
Church
of
Dallas
.

The
TV
evangelist
and
prominent
religious
leader
spent
the
last
two
days
defending
statements
he
made
to
reporters
at
a
conservative
gathering
on
Friday
in
Washington
DC
,
in
which
he
called
Mormonism
a
“
cult
”
just
minutes
after
introducing
and
endorsing
Texas
Republican
presidential
candidate
Rick
Perry
.

The
pastor
,
who
is
known
for
making
blunt
statements
about
religion
and
politics
,
aimed
his
comments
at
Republican
candidate
Mitt
Romney
,
a
Mormon
who
had
avoided
discussions
of
religion
in
the
race
until
Jeffress
made
his
comments
to
reporters
at
the
Values
Voters
Summit
in
Washington
.

Perry
,
an
evangelical
Christian
,
rejected
the
comments
by
Jeffress
and
said
he
did
not
believe
Mormons
were
a
cult
.

Jon
Huntsman
,
former
governor
of
Utah
and
another
Republican
presidential
candidate
,
is
also
a
Mormon
.

On
Sunday
,
politicians
bashed
his
comments
on
morning
talk
shows
,
and
no
one
in
the
Republican
race
would
back
him
up

“
I
am
not
running
for
theologian
in
chief
,
”
Herman
Cain
,
a
former
pizza
executive
who
is
rising
fast
in
polls
,
said
on
CNN
’s

I
am
not
going
to
get
into
an
analysis
of
Mormonism
vs.
Christianity
.

I
’m
not
getting
into
that
,
”
said
Cain
,
who
said
he
was
a
lifelong
Christian
.

But
Jeffress
remained
defiant
in
his
convictions
on
Sunday
during
and
after
his
remarks
at
the
pulpit
.

Absolutely
,
Mormonism
is
a
false
religion
,
”
he
told
Reuters
after
the
service
.

It
was
invented
1800
years
after
the
establishment
of
Christianity
.

Jeffress
,
who
earned
degrees
at
Baylor
University
in
Waco
and
the
Dallas
Theological
Seminary
,
said
he
has
known
Perry
personally
for
several
years
,
but
that
they
are
not
close
.

Local
media
reports
have
said
he
took
part
in
at
least
one
meeting
of
religious
and
political
leaders
,
including
Perry
,
during
the
summer
when
the
Texas
governor
was
still
thinking
about
a
presidential
run
.

But
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
is
a
close
spiritual
advisor
to
the
governor
.

“
We
are
not
hunting
buddies
,
”
he
said
.

I
am
not
the
Jeremiah
Wright
of
the
right
.
”

President
Barack
Obama
cut
ties
with
Wright
,
his
former
pastor
,
after
the
church
leader
made
what
were
attacked
as
anti
-
American
remarks
during
the
2008
presidential
campaign
.

Jeffress
told
his
congregation
that
he
decided
as
a
private
citizen
to
endorse
Perry
to
“
push
back
against
the
evil
that
is
engulfing
our
country
,
”
earning
a
standing
ovation
from
the
crowd
at
the
downtown
church
.

In
spite
of
Jeffress’
attempts
to
distance
himself
from
Perry
,
pointing
out
that
the
remarks
were
not
made
during
his
introduction
or
in
his
endorsement
,
they
have
brought
more
negative
attention
to
Perry
’s
struggling
campaign
.

Jeffress
,
whose
church
boasts
10,000
members
in
a
congregation
that
at
one
point
included
the
Rev.
Billy
Graham
,
is
an
outspoken
preacher
who
says
he
’s
made
more
than
600
appearances
nationally
,
and
who
hosts
both
a
TV
show
and
a
daily
radio
program
in
addition
to
writing
17
books
.

In
the
past
,
effress
has
said
that
Islam
is
a
false
religion
and
that
Oprah
Winfrey
is
doing
the
work
of
Satan
.

I
’m
not
some
radical
fringe
person
,
”
he
said
on
Sunday
,
adding
that
the
Southern
Baptist
Convention
has
long
held
the
position
that
Mormonism
is
not
Christianity
.

He
’s
getting
what
he
thinks
from
the
Bible
,
and
that
’s
where
we
need
to
go
,
”
said
Kathy
Waite
,
a
congregation
member
who
on
Sunday
said
she
has
attended
the
church
since

From
ingenue
to
screen
legend
,
Shirley
has
entertained
a
global
audience
through
song
,
dance
,
laughter
and
tears
,
and
her
career
as

good
measure

Elevated
audit
fees
can
be
a
red
flag
of
problems
to
come
for
a
company
,
say
three
recent
academic
studies
that
together
warn
about
increased
chances
of
fraud
,
stock
price
declines
or
financial
restatements
.

Companies
have
been
disclosing
how
much
they
pay
their
auditors
since
2001
,
when
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
instituted
the
requirement
as
part
of
a
push
to
improve
corporate
auditor
independence
.

The
numbers
may
be
underappreciated
by
investors
,
however
,
who
seem
not
to
recognize
the
special
insights
auditors
have
.

The
auditors
have
private
information
about
the
firm
because
of
their
interaction
with
management
.

They
obviously
have
a
lot
of
risk
associated
with
any
fraud
at
a
firm
,
and
we
assume
they
adjust
their
fee
accordingly
,
”
said
Ryan
Wilson
,
who
teaches
accounting
at
the
Tippie
College
of
Business
at
the
University
of
Iowa
,
in
an
interview
October
5
.

He
co
-
authored
an
April
2010
study
on
the
topic
.

A
high
or
rising
audit
fee
can
indicate
one
of
two
things
,
experts
say
.

Either
the
auditor
is
charging
a
risk
premium
,
aiming
to
cover
future
legal
costs
to
them
of
something
going
awry
,
or
they
may
just
be
doing
more
work
on
the
audit
,
digging
into
areas
where
results
are
uncertain
.

The
studies’
findings
come
at
a
moment
when
regulators
are
considering
requiring
auditors
to
give
out
even
more
information
.

A
proposal
under
consideration
by
the
U.S.
Public
Company
Accounting
Oversight
Board
might
have
auditors
disclosing
more
than
the
current
minimal
thumbs
up
or
down
.

Meantime
,
their
fees
seem
to
be
telling
a
valuable
story
.

Audit
fees
substantially
above
those
paid
by
competitors
and
companies
of
similar
size
are
strongly
associated
with
a
slip
in
operating
performance
the
following
year
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
as
many
as
five
years
later
,
according
to
research
by
Jonathan
Stanley
,
an
accounting
professor
at
Auburn
University
,
published
in
the
current
August
/
October
issue
of
Auditing
,
a
journal
of
the
American
Accounting
Association
.

In
addition
to
forecasting
operating
declines
,
high
audit
fees
are
predictive
of
fraud
and
restatements
,
and
rising
fees
can
foreshadow
steep
stock
price
drops
,
credit
rating
downgrades
and
class
action
lawsuits
,
the
research
has
found
.

American
International
Group
Inc
,
the
insurance
giant
bailed
out
by
the
government
on
the
brink
of
bankruptcy
in
2008
,
is
one
of
a
number
of
examples
cited
in
interviews
with
the
authors
of
the
studies
.

According
to
SEC
filings
,
AIG
paid
$
66
million
for
its
2004
audit
,
a
$
33
million
increase
over
its
2003
fee
.

In
2005
,
the
company
restated
its
2000
,
2001
,
2002
and
2003
numbers
.

Another
example
is
Swedish
mobile
phone
maker
Ericsson
.

Nicole
Thorne
Jenkins
of
Vanderbilt
University
’s
Owen
Graduate
School
of
Management
said
the
fees
climbed
significantly
faster
than
peers’
the
year
before
it
issued
a
36
percent
profit
decline
in
2007
that
sent
its
stock
down
sharply
.

A
2004
sales
shortfall
at
technology
group
Altera
Corp
was
preceded
by
a
rise
in
its
audit
fee
.

PricewaterhouseCoopers
,
the
auditor
of
all
three
companies
,
declined
to
comment
citing
a
policy
of
not
discussing
client
matters
.

Jenkins
said
in
an
October
5
interview
that
her
research
published
April
2011
found
investors
as
a
group
do
not
recognize
the
importance
of
audit
fees
.

Auburn
’s
Stanley
said
investors
should
consider
audit
fees
with
other
metrics
like
short
interest
and
analysts’
forecasts
,
in
an
October
5
interview
.

There
’s
a
link
between
audit
price
and
future
performance
,
”
he
said
.

Unusually
low
fees
may
be
worth
keeping
an
eye
on
too
,
argued
Donald
Whalen
,
director
of
research
for
Audit
Analytics
,
in
an
October
6
interview
.

If
audit
fees
are
way
down
,
how
can
the
auditor
be
performing
the
necessary
work
?

Whalen
highlighted
the
case
of
government
-
backed
loan
purchaser
Fannie
Mae
.

Auditor
KPMG
charged
the
lender
less
than
$
3
million
a
year
in
2001
,
2002
and
2003
.

When
the
company
changed
auditors
in
2004
,
hiring
Deloitte
&
Touche
,
the
fees
went
up
sharply
to
a
dramatic
$
203
million
in
2004
.

Fees
have
since
dropped
,
but
at
$
37
million
for
the
2010
audit
,
they
remain
well
above
KPMG
’s
price
.

Fannie
Mae
’s
regulator
,
the
Office
of
Federal
Housing
Enterprise
Oversight
,
raised
questions
about
the
company
’s
accounting
in
2004
,
after
which
its
stock
dropped
sharply
.

The
company
eventually
restated
2001
-
2004
earnings
,
erasing
$
6.3
billion
of
reported
income
.

After
a
poor
start
to
the
fourth
quarter
,
investors’
mood
may
be
just
starting
to
stabilize
after
moves
by
European
policymakers
to
help
fragile
banks
and
avert
a
financial
meltdown
.

But
it
may
take
a
lot
grander
plan
to
truly
kick
start
a
risk
rally
.

The
coming
week
—
packed
again
with
heavy
political
and
economic
events
—
may
provide
a
key
insight
into
what
kind
of
initiatives
policymakers
are
planning
to
implement
to
stave
off
recession
and
contain
the
effect
of
a
possible
Greek
default
.

World
stocks
,
measured
by
MSCI
.MIWD00000PUS
,
rebounded
8
percent
after
hitting
a
15-month
low
earlier
in
the
week
and
are
on
track
to
post
their
second
weekly
gain
.

This
,
to
an
extent
,
bodes
well
as
the
fourth
quarter
has
been
the
best
period
for
equities
since
1971
,
with
stocks
rising
on
average
3.7
percent
in
the
period
.

What
has
bolstered
the
market
was
some
policy
moves
.

The
Bank
of
England
surprised
investors
on
Thursday
by
launching
a
second
round
of
quantitative
easing
,
pledging
to
buy
a
bigger
-
than
-
expected
75
billion
pounds
of
assets
with
new
money
.

The
European
Central
Bank
followed
up
with
aggressive
liquidity
measures
,
throwing
a
lifeline
to
cash
-
strained
lenders
.

The
European
Union
also
said
it
would
present
a
plan
for
a
coordinated
recapitalization
of
banks
by
member
states
.

For
many
investors
,
who
have
already
moved
to
a
defensive
strategy
of
underweight
equities
and
overweight
bonds
,
it
would
require
a
“
shock
and
awe
”
development
to
turn
their
mood
around
.

“
You
will
probably
need
2
-
3
trillion
euros
to
frighten
the
market
.

We
are
positioned
as
if
the
euro
will
break
up
—
underweight
periphery
,
banks
and
euro
.

We
do
n’t
think
it
will
happen
but
the
market
pain
could
be
as
hard
,
”
said
Carl
Astorri
,
global
head
of
economics
and
asset
strategy
at
Coutts
.

“
Sixty
percent
of
the
world
GDP
is
deleveraging
,
which
slows
down
growth
.

That
’s
a
long
process
,
just
as
credit
bubbles
took
time
to
build
.

We
may
be
in
the
process
for
another
3
-
4
years
.
”

Over
the
weekend
,
French
President
Nicholas
Sarkozy
is
meeting
head
of
IMF
Christine
Lagarde
,
before
moving
to
Berlin
to
meet
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
where
they
are
likely
to
discuss
bank
recapitalization
.

the

rich
BRIC
emerging
nations
—
Brazil
,
Russia
,
India
and
China
—
to
help
the

zone
.

A
source
told
Reuters
the
European
Commission
is
expected
to
present
a
proposal
on
bank
recapitalization
before
the
EU
leaders
summit
on
Oct
17
.

Credit
Suisse
said
it
would
revise
its
underweight
position
of
continental
European
stocks
if
it
saw
an
additional
package
worth
at
least
1
-
1.5
trillion
euros
,
equivalent
to
40
percent
of
outstanding
debt
in
the
peripheral
euro
zone
countries
.

Within
this
,
Credit
Suisse
reckons
European
governments
should
spend
300
-
400
million
euros
to
recapitalize
banks
.

It
also
said
a
weaker
euro
needs
to
be
part
of
the
solution
of
the
euro
zone
problems
,
given
each
10
percent
decline
in
the
euro
adds
0.7
percent
to
European
GDP
growth
.

Following
European
steps
,
there
is
a
tentative
sign
that
strains
on
money
markets
and
banks
are
starting
to
ease
.

The
three
-
month
EURIBOR
-
OIS
spread
is
down
nearly
10
basis
points
this
week
to
74
bps
,
its
lowest
in
a
month
.

In
the
FX
swaps
market
,
the
premium
for
swapping
euro
LIBOR
into
dollar
LIBOR
over
three
months
—
known
as
the
cross
currency
swap
—
eased
to
around
102
bps
,
off
a
September
high
around
123
bps
.

Earlier
in
the
year
,
European
banks
needing
funds
were
forced
to
turn
to
FX
forwards
and
swaps
,
causing
a
sharp
widening
of
the
dollar
premium
in
FX
swaps
,
especially
in
euro
and
yen
markets
.

A
credit
default
swap
index
based
on
25
European
financials
fell
to
252.56
bps
,
down
nearly
19
percent
from
a
September
peak
.

JP
Morgan
said
an
issuance
of
unsecured
bonds
by
Deutsche
Bank
and
ABN
Amro
late
in
September
worth
2
billion
euros
following
a
three
-
month
freeze
presented
an
important
step
for
European
debt
markets
.

“
Coupled
with
(
upcoming
ECB
funding
operations
)
,
it
is
likely
that
bank
bond
issuance
will
improve
further
over
the
coming
weeks
,
boosting
confidence
in
credit
markets
,
”
it
said
.

And
confidence
in
the
credit
market
is
essential
for
a
broader
risk
asset
market
.

“
The
key
thing
to
watch
is
the
corporate
credit
and
government
bond
market
,
which
is
much
better
at
judging
what
’s
going
to
happen
than
equity
markets

,
Oct

(

-
Greek
petroleum
and
electricity
workers
threatened
late
on
Sunday
to

on
strike
,
to
oppose
planned
wage
cuts
that
form

Workers
at
the
country
’s
biggest
refiner
Hellenic
Petroleum
said
they
would
start
a
walkout
on
Tuesday
,
demanding
their
exclusion
from
the
provisions
of
a
draft
law
which
would
cap
their
company
’s
average
wage
cost
per
employee
at
1,900
euros
(
$
2,563
)
a
month
.

The
cap
was
originally
meant
to
apply
just
to
civil
servants
,
as
part
of
spending
cuts
imposed
by
the
EU
and
the
IMF
under
the
cash

strapped
country
’s
ongoing
bailout
programme
.

But
a
last

change
in
the

,
which
was
submitted
to

last

,
it
also
included
in

that
are

on

,
such
as
Hellenic

By

refiners
will
have
ground
to

,
”
Hellenic
’s
labour
union
leader
Panagiotis
Ofthalmides
told

.

Public
discontent
is
rising
in
Greece
as
the
government
is
taking
ever
harsher
austerity
measures
to
compensate
for
fiscal
slippages
which
threaten
to

the
country
’s
EU
/

-
led
rescue
and
plunge
it
into
bankruptcy
.

Workers
at
the
dominant
electricity
producer
PPC

also
vowed
to
oppose
the
law
.

“
PPC
workers
suffered
in
2010
average
pay
cuts
of
between
15
and
50
percent
...

we
wo
n’t
allow
the
destruction
of
our
families
,
”
their
GENOP
labour
union
said
in
a
press
release
.

GENOP
will
decide
later
on
Monday
how
exactly
it
will
oppose
the
law
,
saying
“
it
will
use
all
available
means
of
struggle
”
.

If
lawmakers
approve
the
law
in
its
current
form
,
the
cap
would
also
apply
to
a
string
of
other
listed
companies
such
as
the
country
’s
two
biggest
water
utilities
Athens
Water

and
Thessaloniki
Water
.

Greece
is
expected
to
sell
stakes
in
the
state

Herman
Cain
and
Michele
Bachmann
refused
on
Sunday
to
wade
into
a
controversy
over
a
Texas
pastor
’s
comments
about
rival
Mitt
Romney
’s
Mormon
faith
.

“
I
am
not
running
for
theologian
in
chief
,
”
Cain
,
a
former
pizza
executive
who
is
rising
fast
in
polls
,
said
on
CNN
’s

“
State
of
the
Union
”
show
when
asked
about
the
views
of
Dallas
pastor
Robert
Jeffress
.

“
I
am
not
going
to
get
into
an
analysis
of
Mormonism
versus
Christianity
.

I
’m
not
getting
into
that
,
”
said
Cain
,
who
noted
he
was
a
lifelong
Christian
.

Jeffress
,
who
backs
Texas
Governor
Rick
Perry
in
the
2012
presidential
race
,
said
at
a
conference
of
conservative
voters
on
Friday
that
Mormons
were
a
cult
and
were
not
Christians
.

The
pastor
of
the
10,000-member
First
Baptist
Church
in
Dallas
,
Jeffress
introduced
Perry
at
the
conference
.

Perry
,
who
is
an
evangelical
Christian
,
rejected
Jeffress
’s
comments
and
said
he
did
not
believe
Mormons
were
a
cult
.

But
Jeffress
told
his
congregants
on
Sunday
he
welcomed
the
opportunity
to
warn
people
about
a
“
false
religion
.
”

“
I
have
not
changed
my
position
,
”
Jeffress
told
about
2,000
people
attending
the
early
service
at
First
Baptist
Church
.

He
reiterated
his
conviction
after
the
service
.

Absolutely
,
Mormonism
is
a
false
religion
,
”
he
told
Reuters
.

It
was
invented
1800
years
after
the
establishment
of
Christianity
.

Jeffress
,
who
earned
degrees
at
Baylor
University
in
Waco
and
the
Dallas
Theological
Seminary
,
said
he
has
known
Perry
for
several
years
but
that
they
are
not
close
.

Bachmann
,
also
a
conservative
Christian
,
called
the
controversy
“
inconsequential
”
and
said
jobs
and
the
economy
were
the
topics
of
concern
to
voters
.

“
We
have
religious
tolerance
in
this
country
,

”
said
the
congresswoman
from
Minnesota
.

“
I
do
n’t
think
that
I
’ll
be
judged
based
on
my
faith
as
president
of
the
United
States
,
I
think
I
’ll
be
judged
based
upon
the
good
ideas
that
I
have
to
turn
the
economy
around
and
have
job
creation
.

BRUSSELS
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-
Franco
-
Belgian
bank
Dexia
was
set
to
be
broken
up
and
partly
nationalised
after
being
slammed
by
a
funding
squeeze
in
the
latest
warning
sign
about
the
health
of
Europe
’s
struggling
lenders
.

The
rescue
of
Dexia
,
which
has
global
credit
risk
exposure
of
$
700
billion
—
more
than
twice
Greece
’s
GDP
—
came
as
the
leaders
of
French
and
Germany
agreed
in
a
joint
press
conference
that
European
banks
needed
to
be
recapitalised
,
but
papered
over
differences
on
how
that
would
happen
.

Details
of
the
rescue
were
not
revealed
while
Dexia
’s
board
met
in
Brussels
to
approve
the
plan
,
but
it
will
call
for
the
bank
’s
Belgian
retail
unit
and
French
municipal
finance
operations
to
come
under
government
control
.

Dexia
was
forced
to
seek
state
help
for
the
second
time
in
three
years
after
a
liquidity
crunch
hobbled
the
lender
and
sent
its
shares
down
42
percent
over
the
past
week
.

French
Prime
Minister
Francois
Fillon
,
his
Belgian
counterpart
Yves
Leterme
and
Luc
Frieden
,
the
finance
minister
of
Luxembourg
,
where
Dexia
has
a
large
presence
,
had
found
a
solution
for
the
stricken
Franco
-
Belgian
bank
,
Leterme
’s
office
said
early
Sunday
afternoon
.

The
three
governments
have
agreed
to
put
a
proposal
to
the
board
which
fits
completely
with
the
goals
of
the
Belgian
government
,
which
means
to
take
over
Dexia
Bank
Belgium
,
secure
it
and
turn
it
into
a
very
safe
bank
,
”
Leterme
said
after
two
hours
of
talks
at
Egmont
Palace
in
Brussels
—
also
the
site
of
negotiations
for
a
previous
Dexia
rescue
in
2008
.

At
stake
in
the
talks
is
how
much
each
government
will
have
to
contribute
to
help
wind
down
Dexia
,
a
thorny
subject
given
that
Belgium
and
France
are
already
struggling
to
contain
large
deficits
.

The
need
to
recapitalise
banks
is
emerging
as
another
strain
for
European
governments
whose
budgets
are
already
stretched
.

Belgium
had
a
debt
-
to
-
gross
domestic
product
ratio
of
96.2
percent
last
year
,
lower
only
than
Greece
and
Italy
among
euro
zone
members
and
on
a
par
with
bailout
recipient
Ireland
.

I
am
convinced
that
it
is
possible
...
by
tomorrow
morning
to
have
an
agreement
in
which
Belgium
resolves
the
issue
without
pushing
up
the
debt
level
of
our
country
too
high
,
”
Leterme
told
Belgian
television
before
Sunday
’s
talks
.

The
burden
of
bailing
out
Dexia
led
ratings
agency
Moody
’s
to
warn
Belgium
late
on
Friday
that
its
Aa1
government
bond
ratings
may
fall
.

Dexia
,
which
used
short
-
term
funding
to
finance
long
-
term
lendings
,
has
found
credit
drying
up
as
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
worsened
.

This
problem
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
bank
’s
heavy
exposure
to
Greece
.

Dexia
’s
near
collapse
stoked
investors’
anxieties
about
the
strength
of
European
banks
and
coincided
with
growing
talk
about
coordinated
EU
action
to
recapitalise
banks
across
the
continent
.

Germany
and
France
have
so
far
been
split
over
how
to
recapitalise
shaky
European
banks
.

Paris
wants
to
tap
the
euro
zone
’s
440
billion
euro
(
$
594
billion
)

European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)
to
recapitalise
French
banks
,
while
Berlin
is
insisting
the
fund
should
be
used
as
a
last
resort
.

There
were
fresh
reports
over
the
weekend
that
France
’s
top
banks
BNP
Paribas
and
Societe
Generale
could
agree
to
capital
injections
as
part
of
a
Europe
-
wide
plan
to
boost
lenders’
financial
strength
,
although
both
banks
continue
to
deny
such
plans
.

Dexia
’s
overhaul
will
likely
see
its
French
municipal
financing
arm
split
from
the
group
and
merged
with
French
state
bank
Caisse
des
Depots
and
Banque
Postale
,
the
French
post
office
’s
banking
arm
.

The
Belgian
government
will
nationalise
Dexia
’s
largely
retail
banking
business
in
Belgium
.

Media
reports
said
it
would
have
to
pay
4
billion
euros
to
do
so
.

Healthy
units
,
such
as
Denizbank
in
Turkey
,
will
be
sold
.

A
‘
bad
bank’
supported
by
state
guarantees
will
hold
95
billion
euros
in
bonds
,
including
12
billion
euros
of
sovereign
debt
of
weaker
euro
zone
periphery
nations
.

Including
7
billion
euros
of
securities
linked
to
U.S.
mortgages
,
France
and
Belgium
may
need
to
provide
guarantees
to
cover
up
to
200
billion
euros
of
assets
,
which
would
be
more
than
55
percent
of
Belgian
GDP
.

Belgium
,
under
an
agreement
reached
between
the
governments
on
Sunday
,
will
guarantee
60
percent
of
the
bad
assets
while
France
will
be
responsible
for
most
of
the
rest
,
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
said
.

The
key
issues
are
how
to
divide
up
the
‘
bad
bank’
asset
guarantees
,
how
much
Belgium
should
pay
to
nationalise
Dexia
’s
Belgian
banking
business
and
whether
others
,
such
as
Belgium
’s
regions
,
would
be
involved
in
its
purchase
.

Dexia
’s
shares
have
been
suspended
since
Thursday
afternoon
.

An
unusual
number
of
potential
awards
movies
have
yet
to
be
seen
,
but
that
does
n't
mean
studios
have
n't
released
some
glimpses
of
"
War
Horse
"
and
"
J.
Edgar
"
and
"
The
Girl
With
the
Dragon
Tattoo
"
and
others
.

In
fact
,
the
past
week
brought
several
such
marketing
goodies
.

The
"
J.
Edgar
"
poster
(
left
)
,
with
its
image
of
Leonardo
DiCaprio
's
J.
Edgar
Hoover
,
his
face
contorted
in
rage
,
is
one
example
.

Jason
Reitman
's
"
Young
Adult
"
—

which
bypassed
the
filmmaker
's
typical
Toronto
debut
—
will
be
released
in
December
in
the
same
slot
that
Paramount
successfully
used
last
year
for
"
The
Fighter
.
"

The
film
stars
Charlize
Theron
as
a
successful
writer
who
returns
to
her
hometown
to
try
to
win
back
her
now
-
married
high
school
sweetheart
.

Judging
from
the
trailer
,
Theron
's
character
is
unpleasant
,
Diablo
Cody
's
dialogue
is
as
smart
-
alecky
as
ever
and
Patton
Oswalt
has
the
semi
-
loveable
sidekick
role
.

Steven
Spielberg
's
"
War
Horse
,
"

which
sight
unseen
has
topped
some
Oscar
-
watchers
'
polls
,
released
a
second
trailer
—
which
,
like
the
first
,
is
long
on
stirring
romantic
music
,
sweeping
shots
and
,
on
occasion
,
that
patented
Spielbergian
rosy
glow
,
this
time
suffusing
a
horse
in
World
War
I
rather
than
an
alien
in
suburbia
.

We
'll
have
to
wait
before
answering
that
one
.

In
Europe
,
Spielberg
's
other

2011
movie
will
bow
well
before
"
War
Horse
.
"

"
The
Adventures
of
Tintin
"
will
be
released
in
October
in
the
UK
,
with
a
new
European
trailer
dropping
this
past
week
.

The
film
,
which
was
made
using
performance
-
capture
technology
—
and
which
is
looking
to
be
classified
as
an
animated
feature
by
the
Academy
—
looks
like
a
cartoon
at
some
points
in
the
trailer
and
an
Indiana
Jones
movie
at
other
points
.

The
action
happens
too
fast
to
really
ascertain
if
Spielberg
has
solved
the
infamous
problem
of
dead
eyes
in
motion
capture
characters
.

Clint
Eastwood
's
biopic
"
J.
Edgar
"
released
its
own
trailer
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
after
which
pundits
hurried
to
judge
DiCaprio
's
awards
worthiness
on
the
basis
of
a
handful
of
snippets
that
may
or
may
not
accurately
capture
his
entire
performance
.

Warner
Bros.
has
followed
with
two
posters
for
the
film
,
above
and
to
the
right
.

The
image
in
both
is
the
same
:
a
profile
shot
of
DiCaprio
as
a
very
angry
and
thoroughly
unpleasant
-
looking
J.
Edgar
Hoover
,
with
the
caption
(
too
small
to
read
in
these
reproductions
)
"

The
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
.
"

One
wonders
how
hard
the
film
will
have
to
work
to
justify
that
hyperbole
.

Shame
,
"
the
sexually
explicit
drama
due
for
a
December
2
release
from
Fox
Searchlight
.

While
the
film
quickly
became
famous
in
festival
circles
for
its
full
-
frontal
nudity
from
stars
Michael
Fassbender
and
Carey
Mulligan
,
the
poster
takes
the
opposite
tack
:
it
does
n't
feature
any
skin
at
all
.

But
the
implications
of
its
unmade
bedsheets
are
pretty
clear
,
and
the
image
quite
striking
.

Back
on
the
trailer
front
,
the
Weinstein
Company
provided
a
first
look
at
Michelle
Williams
'
reputedly
Oscar
-
worthy
performance
as
Marilyn
Monroe
in
"
My
Week
With
Marilyn
"
just
a
few
days
before
the
film
had
its
premiere
at
the
New
York
Film
Festival
.

It
's
safe
to
say
that
everybody
in
the
trailer
is
overshadowed
by
Williams
—
except
maybe
Judi
Dench
,
who
only
needs
a
line
or
two
to
be
memorable
.

Finally
,
David
Fincher
's
"
The
Girl
With
the
Dragon
Tattoo
"
got
another
trailer
to
follow
its
initial
teaser
,
and
the
eight
-
minute
assemblage
released
almost
a
month
ago
.

Like
its
predecessors
,
the
new
trailer
is
cold
and
stylish
and
striking
.

And
as
that
trailer
hit
,
so
did
a
series
of
photos
of
"
Dragon
Tattoo
"
star
Rooney
Mara
taken
by

CAIRO
(
Reuters
)
-
Egypt
’s
army
rulers
imposed
a
curfew
on
Cairo
’s
Tahrir
Square
and
downtown
area
,
state
media
announced
Sunday
,
after
19
people
were
reported
killed
in
clashes
between
Christians
and
military
police
in
the
center
of
the
capital
.

Christians
protesting
against
an
attack
on
a
church
clashed
with
military
police
,
witnesses
and
security
sources
said
,
in
fighting
that
spread
across
the
downtown
area
.

Tahrir
was
the
epicentre
of
the
February
uprising
that
overthrew
former
President
Hosni
Mubarak
.

The
curfew
would
last
from
2
am
to
7
am
(
0000
-
0500
GMT
)
on
Monday
,
state
TV
reported
.

Franco
-
Belgian
bank
Dexia
was
set
to
be
broken
up
and
partly
nationalised
after
being
slammed
by
a
funding
squeeze
in
the
latest
warning
sign
about
the
health
of
Europe
’s
struggling
lenders
.

The
rescue
of
Dexia
,
which
has
global
credit
risk
exposure
of
$
700
billion
—
more
than
twice
Greece
’s
GDP
—
came
as
the
leaders
of
French
and
Germany
agreed
in
a
joint
press
conference
that
European
banks
needed
to
be
recapitalised
,
but
papered
over
differences
on
how
that
would
happen
.

Details
of
the
rescue
were
not
revealed
while
Dexia
’s
board
met
in
Brussels
to
approve
the
plan
,
but
it
will
call
for
the
bank
’s
Belgian
retail
unit
and
French
municipal
finance
operations
to
come
under
government
control
.

Dexia
was
forced
to
seek
state
help
for
the
second
time
in
three
years
after
a
liquidity
crunch
hobbled
the
lender
and
sent
its
shares
down
42
percent
over
the
past
week
.

French
Prime
Minister
Francois
Fillon
,
his
Belgian
counterpart
Yves
Leterme
and
Luc
Frieden
,
the
finance
minister
of
Luxembourg
,
where
Dexia
has
a
large
presence
,
had
found
a
solution
for
the
stricken
Franco
-
Belgian
bank
,
Leterme
’s
office
said
early
Sunday
afternoon
.

The
three
governments
have
agreed
to
put
a
proposal
to
the
board
which
fits
completely
with
the
goals
of
the
Belgian
government
,
which
means
to
take
over
Dexia
Bank
Belgium
,
secure
it
and
turn
it
into
a
very
safe
bank
,
”
Leterme
said
after
two
hours
of
talks
at
Egmont
Palace
in
Brussels
—
also
the
site
of
negotiations
for
a
previous
Dexia
rescue
in
2008
.

At
stake
in
the
talks
is
how
much
each
government
will
have
to
contribute
to
help
wind
down
Dexia
,
a
thorny
subject
given
that
Belgium
and
France
are
already
struggling
to
contain
large
deficits
.

The
need
to
recapitalise
banks
is
emerging
as
another
strain
for
European
governments
whose
budgets
are
already
stretched
.

Belgium
had
a
debt
-
to
-
gross
domestic
product
ratio
of
96.2
percent
last
year
,
lower
only
than
Greece
and
Italy
among
euro
zone
members
and
on
a
par
with
bailout
recipient
Ireland
.

I
am
convinced
that
it
is
possible
...
by
tomorrow
morning
to
have
an
agreement
in
which
Belgium
resolves
the
issue
without
pushing
up
the
debt
level
of
our
country
too
high
,
”
Leterme
told
Belgian
television
before
Sunday
’s
talks
.

The
burden
of
bailing
out
Dexia
led
ratings
agency
Moody
’s
to
warn
Belgium
late
on
Friday
that
its
Aa1
government
bond
ratings
may
fall
.

Dexia
,
which
used
short
-
term
funding
to
finance
long
-
term
lendings
,
has
found
credit
drying
up
as
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
worsened
.

This
problem
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
bank
’s
heavy
exposure
to
Greece
.

Dexia
’s
near
collapse
stoked
investors’
anxieties
about
the
strength
of
European
banks
and
coincided
with
growing
talk
about
coordinated
EU
action
to
recapitalise
banks
across
the
continent
.

Germany
and
France
have
so
far
been
split
over
how
to
recapitalise
shaky
European
banks
.

Paris
wants
to
tap
the
euro
zone
’s
440
billion
euro
(
$
594
billion
)

European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)
to
recapitalise
French
banks
,
while
Berlin
is
insisting
the
fund
should
be
used
as
a
last
resort
.

There
were
fresh
reports
over
the
weekend
that
France
’s
top
banks
BNP
Paribas
and
Societe
Generale
could
agree
to
capital
injections
as
part
of
a
Europe
-
wide
plan
to
boost
lenders’
financial
strength
,
although
both
banks
continue
to
deny
such
plans
.

Dexia
’s
overhaul
will
likely
see
its
French
municipal
financing
arm
split
from
the
group
and
merged
with
French
state
bank
Caisse
des
Depots
and
Banque
Postale
,
the
French
post
office
’s
banking
arm
.

The
Belgian
government
will
nationalise
Dexia
’s
largely
retail
banking
business
in
Belgium
.

Media
reports
said
it
would
have
to
pay
4
billion
euros
to
do
so
.

Healthy
units
,
such
as
Denizbank
in
Turkey
,
will
be
sold
.

A
‘
bad
bank’
supported
by
state
guarantees
will
hold
95
billion
euros
in
bonds
,
including
12
billion
euros
of
sovereign
debt
of
weaker
euro
zone
periphery
nations
.

Including
7
billion
euros
of
securities
linked
to
U.S.
mortgages
,
France
and
Belgium
may
need
to
provide
guarantees
to
cover
up
to
200
billion
euros
of
assets
,
which
would
be
more
than
55
percent
of
Belgian
GDP
.

Belgium
,
under
an
agreement
reached
between
the
governments
on
Sunday
,
will
guarantee
60
percent
of
the
bad
assets
while
France
will
be
responsible
for
most
of
the
rest
,
sources
familiar
with
the
talks
said
.

The
key
issues
are
how
to
divide
up
the
‘
bad
bank’
asset
guarantees
,
how
much
Belgium
should
pay
to
nationalise
Dexia
’s
Belgian
banking
business
and
whether
others
,
such
as
Belgium
’s
regions
,
would
be
involved
in
its
purchase
.

Dexia
’s
shares
have
been
suspended
since
Thursday
afternoon
.

Germany
’s
markets
regulator
told
RHJ
that
it
believed
the
private
equity
house
was
unable
to
fund
the
deal
and
therefore
needed
to
withdraw
its
application
to
buy
BHF
,
one
of
the
people
familiar
with
the
matter
said
.

Deutsche
Bank
and
BaFin
declined
to
comment
.

RHJ
was
not
immediately
available
for
comment
.

German
daily
Financial
Times
Deutschland
was
first
to
report
that
BaFin
had
demanded
the
deal
to
be
put
on
ice
,
according
to
an
excerpt
of
its
Monday
edition
.

In
July
,
RHJ
International
said
it
was
in
exclusive
negotiations
to
acquire
BHF
,
adding
that
it
planned
to
finance
the
purchase
with
the
support
of
co
-
investors
.

The
costs
of
funding
BHF
once
it
is
split
from
Deutsche
Bank
have
risen
due
to
strains
in
the
inter
-
bank
lending
market
,
a
factor
that
has
deterred
potential
partners
for
co
-
investor
Kleinwort
Benson
.

Deutsche
Bank
has
been
on
the
lookout
for
a
buyer
ever
since
it
inherited
BHF
through
the
1
billion
euro
purchase
of
Sal
.

Deutsche
Bank
’s
initial
plan
to
sell
BHF
to
LGT
[
LGT.UL
]
,
owned
by
the
royal
family
of
Liechtenstein
,
was
scuppered
in
April
after
the
deal
was
blocked
by
German
regulator
BaFin
.

BHF
is
a
150-year
-
old
institution
with
roughly
1,500
employees
and
40
billion
euros

(

The
Oakland
Raiders
earned
a
dramatic
victory
that
would
have
delighted
late
owner
Al
Davis
as
they
beat
the
Houston
Texans
25
-
20
on
Sunday
while
the
New
Orleans
Saints
and
Buffalo
Bills
moved
to
4
-
1
records
with
wins
in
week
five
of
the
National
Football
League
season
.

The
outspoken
Davis
died
at
age
82
on
Saturday
but
the
Raiders
,
wearing
“
AL
”
stickers
on
their
helmets
,
carried
out
his
motto

”
as
Michael
Huff
grabbed
an
interception
off
Texans
quarterback
Matt
Schaub
in
the
end
zone
on
the
final
play
.

Raiders
coach
Hue
Jackson
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
on
the
sideline
while
players
embraced
each
other
as
the
emotional
game
ended
.

Once
again
Sebastian
Janikowski
was
the
spine
of
the
win
for
the
Raiders
(
3
-
2
)
,
kicking
four
field
goals
,
three
of
them
from
50
yards
or
more
.

Arian
Foster
put
up
some
big
numbers
for
the
Texans
with
116
yards
receiving
and
68
yards
rushing
,
but
Houston
missed
injured
receiver
Andre
Johnson
who
was
sidelined
with
a
hamstring
injury
.

The
Carolina
Panthers
,
with
rookie
quarterback
Cam
Newton
scoring
three
touchdowns
(
one
rushing
)
and
passing
for
224
yards
,
pushed
the
Saints
all
the
way
before
losing
30
-
27
.

A
Greg
Olsen
touchdown
on
a
five
-
yard
Newton
pass
put
Carolina
up
27
-
23
in
the
fourth
but
New
Orleans
came
back
with
Drew
Brees
finding
Pierre
Thomas
open
on
the
right
for
the
winning
touchdown
.

Despite
another
encouraging
display
,
the
Panthers
,
who
won
just
twice
last
year
,
fall
to
1
-
4
.

The
Buffalo
Bills’
impressive
start
continued
as
they
took
advantage
of
four
interceptions
by
Philadelphia
Eagles
quarterback
Michael
Vick
in
a
31
-
24
win
.

Fred
Jackson
rushed
for
111
yards
and
a
touchdown
for
the
Bills
and
also
had
85
yards
receiving
against
an
Eagles
team
(
1
-
4
)
that
,
after
being
considered
Super
Bowl
contenders
in
the
pre
-
season
,
have
now
suffered
four
consecutive
defeats
.

In
one
of
Sunday
’s
surprise
results
,
the
Seattle
Seahawks
enjoyed
a
36
-
25
win
at
the
New
York
Giants
.

Backup
quarterback
Charlie
Whitehurst
put
Seattle
ahead
with
a
27-yard
touchdown
pass
to
Doug
Baldwin
before
Brandon
Browner
grabbed
an
interception
on
a
pass
tip
and
ran
94
yards
for
a
score
that
put
the
game
beyond
the
Giants
.

Giants
quarterback
Eli
Manning
threw
for
420
yards
and
three
touchdowns
but
also
had
three
interceptions
.

The
Minnesota
Vikings
got
their
first
win
of
the
season
,
in
some
style
,
with
running
back
Adrian
Peterson
rushing
for
three
touchdowns
in
the
first
quarter
against
Arizona
in
a
34
-
10
victory
.

There
is
still
no
victory
for
the
Indianapolis
Colts
who
have
been
without
quarterback
Peyton
Manning
all
season
and
were
beaten
28
-
24
by
the
Kansas
City
Chiefs
.

Matt
Cassel
threw
for
four
touchdowns
and
257
yards
as
the
Chiefs
scored
21
points
unanswered
to
wipe
out
a
good
first
half
from
the

Moderate
left
-
wing
candidate
Francois
Hollande
led
in
a
primary
vote
for
the
French
Socialist
Party
’s
presidential
nomination
on
Sunday
,
bolstering
his
position
as
the
favorite
to
unseat
conservative
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
in
April
.

More
than
two
million
people
voted
in
France
’s
first
U.S
.-
style
primary
election
to
select
a
presidential
candidate
,
which
the
Socialists
say
was
inspired
by
the
process
that
gave
Barack
Obama
the
momentum
to
take
the
White
House
.

The
Socialist
Party
published
preliminary
results
showing
Hollande
in
front
with
39
percent
of
votes
,
short
of
an
absolute
majority
and
therefore
headed
for
a
runoff
on
October
16
.

He
will
face
Martine
Aubry
,
a
one
-
time
labor
minister
and
daughter
of
former
European
Commission
president
Jacques
Delors
.

She
won
31
percent
in
the
preliminary
readout
.

Opinion
polls
have
predicted
that
Hollande
,
a
witty
if
unexciting
party
veteran
who
has
never
been
a
government
minister
,
would
not
only
win
the
Socialist
primary
but
would
defeat
Sarkozy
by
a
comfortable
margin
if
the
two
face
off
in
the
presidential
battle
next
April
.

That
would
make
him
the
first
Socialist
leader
in
the
Elysee
Palace
for
17
years
.

The
contenders
and
Socialist
Party
chief
Harlem
Desir
described
the
turnout
on
a
drizzly
day
across
much
of
the
country
as
a
triumph
for
democracy
,
the
party
and
its
future
presidential
candidate
.

Previous
primaries
were
closed
-
shop
events
,
limited
to
about
200,000
party
members
in
a
country
of
more
than
65
million
.

time
,
any
registered
voter
who
paid
a
euro
(
$
1.35
)
and
professed
to
support
left
-
wing
values
could
participate
.

“
It
’s
not
expensive
to
get
rid
of
Sarkozy
,
”
Hollande
said
before
Sunday
’s
ballot
,
where
he
competed
with
five
others
including
Aubry
and
Segolene
Royal
,
his
former
partner
and
mother
of
his
four
children
.

After
Sunday
’s
results
,
Hollande
appealed
to
all
voters
to
back
him
in
the
October
16
runoff
.

The
winning
candidate
will
have
the
job
of
beating
the
right
and
sidelining
the
far
right
.

As
of
today
I
am
in
a
position
to
meet
that
challenge
,
”
he
told
supporters
in
Paris
.

“
Do
what
it
takes
so
that
when
the
second
round
is
over
I
will
be
the
candidate
who
allows
France
to
recover
confidence
in
itself
,
”
he
added
.

Aubry
too
flexed
her
muscles
for
the
final
duel
,
speaking
to
supporters
after
the
other
four
contenders
conceded
defeat
.

“
I
will
unite
all
those
who
want
this
change
and
beat
Sarkozy
in
2012
,
”
she
said
.

The
Socialists
were
deprived
of
a
potentially
strong
candidate
this
year
when
Dominique
Strauss
-
Kahn
resigned
his
post
as
head
of
the
International
Monetary
Fund
after
being
charged
with
a
sex
assault
in
New
York
.

The
charges
were
later
dropped
,
but
Strauss
-
Kahn
’s
political
career
has
not
recovered
.

Hollande
’s
closest
rival
has
always
been
Aubry
,
minister
from
1997
to
2002
when
a
left
-
wing
government
last
held
office
.

In
one
surprise
,
the
preliminary
results
showed
anti
-
globalisation
contender
Arnaud
Montebourg
in
third
place
with
about
17
percent
of
votes
.

Royal
,
who
lost
the
2007
presidential
election
to
Sarkozy
,
had
been
expected
to
place
third
but
sank
to
a
score
of
seven
percent
.

The
final
results
were
not
expected
before
0930
GMT
on
Monday
at
the
earliest
,
said
Jean
-
Pierre
Mignard
,
a
spokesman
for
the
body
in
charge
of
overseeing
the
ballot
.

There
had
been
no
reports
of
voting
irregularities
and
no
complaints
late
into
Sunday
,
he
added
.

The
novelty
of
the
primary
contest
may
give
the
Socialists
a
boost
if
,
in
addition
to
the
healthy
turnout
,
it
produces
a
clear
-
cut
winner
,
political
analysts
say
.

Millions
have
tuned
into
live
television
debates
between
the
Socialist
candidates
in
the
past
three
weeks
as
the
primary
appeared
to
capture
the
popular
imagination
.

Sarkozy
’s
UMP
party
,
which
criticised
the
Socialists’
motives
for
the
innovation
at
the
outset
,
is
considering
doing
the
same
,
not
in
time
for
the
upcoming
presidential
election
but
the
one
after
it
,
says
Prime
Minister
Francois
Fillon
.

In
opinion
polls
,
Sarkozy
remains
deeply
unpopular
and
voters
are
ready
to
see
the
left
take
power
.

Parliamentary
elections
will
be
held
on
the
heels
of
the
presidential
election
,
with
a
first
ballot
on
April
22
and
run
-
off
on
May
6
.

Socialist
primary
sparred
on
occasion
,
Hollande
and
Aubry
have
often
been
accused
of
not
being
very
different
on
policy
even
if
,
on
style
,
Aubry
comes
across
as
slightly
more
old
-
schhol
left
that
Hollande
.

Their
party
manifesto
established
the
basic
thrust
of
their
policy
,
which
is
to
repeal
50
billion
euros
of
tax
breaks
introduced
under
Sarkozy
,
using
half
of
that
money
to
cut
the
deficit
and
the
other
half
to
promote
jobs
and
economic
growth
.

Moses
Mosop
of
Kenya
set
a
course
record
in
cruising
to
victory
in
the
Chicago
Marathon
on
Sunday
in
a
race
tempered
by
the
first
death
in
the
event
in
four
years
after
a
runner
collapsed
near
the
finish
line
.

The
male
runner
collapsed
about
500
yards
from
the
finish
line
and
within
50
yards
of
doctors
,
who
responded
immediately
,
marathon
spokeswoman
Robin
Monsky
said
.

Five
doctors
worked
to
revive
him
but
could
not
and
the
man
was
pronounced
dead
1
hour
and
45
minutes
later
at
a
local
hospital
,
Monsky
said
.

The
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
’s
Office
confirmed
the
runner
’s
death
,
but
declined
to
release
his
identity
or
any
other
details
.

The
last
death
in
the
Chicago
Marathon
occurred
in
2007
,
when
temperatures
climbed
to
90
degrees
F
(
32
C
)
with
high
humidity
.

Some
300
runners
were
taken
to
hospital
suffering
from
heat
-
related
illness
and
the
race
was
halted
early
.

Conditions
were
milder
this
year
with
Sunday
afternoon
highs
reaching
only
73
degrees
at
a
lake
front
gauge
near
Grant
Park
where
the
race
started
and
finished
,
according
to
the
National
Weather
Service
.

Marathon
organizers
reported
transporting
54
individuals
to
area
hospitals
,
down
from
100
last
year
.

Temperatures
on
the
Chicago
lakefront
were
in
the
mid-60s
for
the
first
two
hours
of
the
race
and
did
not
reach
as
high
as
expected
through
midday
when
the
bulk
of
the
runners
were
working
their
way
through
the
city
’s
neighborhoods
.

Earlier
in
the
day
,
Mosop
surged
away
from
an
elite
field
of
runners
with
seven
miles
to
go
,
setting
a
course
record
of
two
hours
five
minutes
and
37
seconds
and
waving
to
the
crowd
as
he
trotted
toward
the
finish
line
.

Liliya
Shobukhova
of
Russia
won
the
women
’s
competition
for
the
third
straight
year
in
two
hours
eighteen
minutes
and
20
seconds
,
beating
the
second
place
women

’s
finisher
by
nearly
four
minutes
.

Both
winners’
times
were
unofficial
.

Mosop
,
who
had
the
second
fastest
marathon
time
on
record
in
losing
the
Boston
Marathon
by
4
seconds
earlier
this
year
,
quickly
countered
a
breakaway
by
countryman
Wesley
Korir
after
the
19
mile
mark
and
never
looked
back
in
breaking
the
course
record
set
two
years
ago
.

Korir
finished
38
seconds
behind
Mosop
in
second
place
.

Bernard
Kipyego
of
Kenya
was
third
.

In
a
post
-
race
interview
,
Mosop
said
he
had
been
prepared
to
challenge
for
a
course
record
,
but
not
the
world
record
because
a
leg
injury
had
limited
his
training
.

I
’m
very
happy
about
my
job
today
,
”
Mosop
said
in
the
interview
on
NBC
television
,
which
carried
the
race
.

Ryan
Hall
,
a
pre
-
race
favorite
,
finished
fifth
overall
in
2:08:04
and
was
the
top
American
.

Hall
’s
was
the
third
fastest
American
performance
on
record
for
the
Chicago
Marathon
trailing
only
Khalid
Khannouchi
’s
two
wins
in
2002
and
2000
.

The
Chicago
marathon
course
is
considered
ideal
for
record
-
setting
performances
when
conditions
are
right
.

The
route
cuts
through
two
dozen
ethnic
neighborhoods
between
its
start
and
finish
in
Grant
Park
adjacent
to
downtown
.

Mosop
had
the
second
fastest
marathon
in
history
in
Boston
at
2:03:06
,
just
behind
Geoffrey
Mutai
of
Kenya
who
set
the
marathon
record
at
2:03:02
.

Partly
because
Boston
is
a
point
-
to
-
point
course
and
there
was
a
strong
tailwind
,
those
times
were
not
recognized
as
world
records
.

The
current
world
record
in
the
marathon
is
2:03:38
,
set
September
25
in
Berlin
by
Kenya
’s
Patrick
Makau
.

Shobukhova
had
the
second
fastest
time
ever
for
a
woman
in
the
Chicago
Marathon
behind
Paula
Radcliffe
of
Great
Britain
who
set
a
then
-
world
record
of
2:17:18
in
2002
.

Ethiopian
track
star
Ejegayehu
Dibaba
,
who
was
making
her
marathon
debut
,
ran
alongside
Shobukhova
until
about
the
15
mile
mark
before
slipping
off
the
pace
.

Some
45,000
runners
were
registered
for
the
race
with
more
than
100
countries
represented
.

Race
organizers
expected
some
1.7
million
spectators
to
watch
along
the
route
.

About
35,600
runners
were
listed
as
finishing
the
race
as
of
4:30
p.m.

putting

fierce
resistance

(
New
story
)

Libyan
transitional
government
forces
attacked
deposed
leader
Muammar
Gaddafi
’s
security
headquarters
in
the
centre
of
his
hometown
of
Sirte
,
hoping
that
once
the
buildings
had
been
captured
the
fight
for
the
city
would
be
won
.

The
protracted
battle
for
Sirte
,
a
showpiece
Mediterranean
coastal
city
largely
loyal
to
Gaddafi
,
has
led
to
concerns
the
many
civilian
casualties
will
breed
long
-
term
hostility
that
will
make
it
very
hard
for
the
National
Transitional
Council
(
NTC
)
to
unite
the
country
once
the
fighting
is
over
.

NTC
forces
have
repeatedly
claimed
to
be
on
the
point
of
victory
in
Sirte
,
only
to
suffer
sudden
reversals
at
the
hands
of
a
tenacious
enemy
fighting
for
its
life
,
surrounded
on
three
sides
and
with
its
back
to
the
sea
.

But
as
night
fell
on
Sunday
,
pick
-
up
trucks
mounted
with
anti
-
aircraft
guns
pounded
the
white
security
buildings
on
a
tree
-
lined
square
with
a
fountain
in
the
centre
while
infantry
blasted
away
with
AK-47s
from
behind
a
high
concrete
wall
,
Reuters
witnesses
said
.

One
of
the
pick
-
up
gunners
was
shot
in
the
face
,
his
gun
rotating
repeatedly
on
its
axis
as
he
fell
dead
to
the
ground
.

“
We
are
now
in
the
centre
of
Sirte
,
”

Colonel
Salam
Al
Shalmany
told
Reuters
at
the
scene
.

They
are
in
these
buildings
about
half
a
kilometre
from
where
we
are
.

But
advances
by
NTC
forces
have
often
proved
fragile
.

Earlier
on
Sunday
,
a
large
group
of
fighters
,
approaching
Sirte
from
the
west
and
trying
to
pin
down
Gaddafi
loyalists
against
the
sea
,
saw
their
advance
suddenly
collapse
into
a
rout
under
heavy
and
accurate
mortar
bombardment
.

Their
trademark
pick
-
up
trucks
raced
to
the
rear
,
some
running
on
flat
tyres
.

One
man
with
arm
and
leg
wounds
frantically
limped
away
from
the
carnage
as
commanders
screamed
over
the
radios
for
their
troops
to
pull
back
.

Soon
seven
fighters
lay
dead
in
a
field
hospital
while
dozens
more
were
being
treated
for
shrapnel
wounds
.

Elsewhere
in
the
city
,
grown
rich
on
42
years
of
Gaddafi
largesse
,
troops
and
residents
still
loyal
to
the
former
leader
launched
counter
attacks
after
losing
three
landmark
buildings
—
the
hospital
,
the
university
and
the
lavish
Ouagadougou
centre
,
built
to
host
summits
of
foreign
dignitaries
.

Despite
the
counter
strikes
,
the
buildings
appeared
to
remain
in
NTC
hands
.

But
in
just
one
field
hospital
to
the
east
of
the
city
,
doctors
said
they
had
received
17
dead
and
87
wounded
in
Sunday
’s
fighting
.

NTC
chairman
Abdel
Jalil
told
a
news
conference
in
the
capital
Tripoli
that
his
men
had
reached
Sirte
city
centre
and
were
combing
the
town
for
snipers
.

The
only
other
major
Gaddafi
-
held
town
,
Bani
Walid
,
in
the
desert
to
the
south
,
was
also
under
siege
from
no
fewer
than
five
sides
,
he
said
.

“
I
think
and
I
hope
,
with
the
help
of
God
,
the
liberation
of
these
two
towns
will
be
completed
by
the
end
of
this
week
.

The
prolonged
struggle
to
capture
Sirte
and
the
other
few
remaining
bastions
of
pro
-
Gaddafi
loyalists
has
delayed
NTC
efforts
to
set
up
effective
government
and
restart
oil
production
,
the
lifeblood
of
the
Libyan
economy
.

Sirte
holds
symbolic
significance
because
Gaddafi
turned
it
from
a
fishing
village
into
a
second
capital
.

He
built
opulent
villas
,
hotels
and
conference
halls
to
house
the
international
summits
he
liked
to
stage
there
.

Thousands
of
civilians
have
fled
Sirte
as
fighting
has
intensified
,
describing
increasingly
desperate
conditions
for
those
still
inside
the
seafront
city
.

There
is
no
electricity
while
drinking
water
and
food
are
running
out
.

By

BRATISLAVA
,
Oct
10
(
Reuters
)
-
Slovakia
’s
coalition
leaders
meet
on
Monday
in
a
last
-
ditch
bid
to
reach
agreement
on
widening
the
mandate
of
the
euro
zone
’s
bailout
fund
before
parliament
votes
on
Tuesday
.

Only
Slovakia
and
Malta
have
yet
to
approve
extra
powers
for
the
European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)
in
its
fight
against
the
spiralling
sovereign
debt
crisis
,
while
the
other
15
euro
zone
members
are
already
debating
longer
-
term
measures
.

The
small
liberal
Freedom
and
Solidarity
(
SaS
)
party
argues
that
the
zone
’s
second
poorest
member
is
being
asked
to
pay
more
than
its
fair
share
,
but
says
it
is
still
open
to
negotiation
.

We
will
negotiate
until
the
last
minute
,
”
Richard
Sulik
,
the
parliamentary
speaker
and
head
of
SaS
,
said
in
a
TV
debate
on
Sunday
.

All
euro
countries
must
give
the
green
light
to
boost
the
EFSF
’s
effective
lending
capacity
to
440
billion
euros
(
$
594
billion
)
,
and
allow
it
to
buy
states’
debt
,
recapitalise
banks
facing
solvency
troubles
and
provide
precautionary
credit
lines
.

Both
Italy
and
Spain
were
downgraded
by
the
credit
rating
agency
Fitch
on
Friday
,
underlining
the
urgency
of
measures
designed
on
particular
to
shield
other
euro
zone
countries
from
Greece
’s
spiralling
economic
and
debt
crisis
.

Prime
Minister
Iveta
Radicova
can
be
sure
of
getting
EFSF
approval
through
the
Slovak
parliament
eventually
.

But
if
SaS
does
not
back
her
,
she
will
have
to
rely
on
the
opposition
,
who
have
demanded
a
cabinet
reshuffle
or
a
fresh
election
as
the
price
for
their
support
.

Sulik
says
Slovakia
should
not
have
to
pay
for
the
mistakes
of
Greece
and
others
who
have
overspent
and
overborrowed
.

He
said
the
average
Slovak
would
have
to
work
300
hours
to
pay
for
their
EFSF
contribution
,
against
120
hours
for
a
German
.

“
We
are
going
to
support
countries
like
Italy
via
bond
buys
,
we
will
be
saving
French
banks
holding
billions
in
assets
and
our
salary
is
the
lowest
in
the
euro
zone
,
”
Sulik
said
.

The
SaS
says
it
will
vote
‘
yes’
to
the
EFSF
only
if
Slovakia
’s
participation
is
restricted
,
and
it
stays
out
of
the
planned
permanent
rescue
mechanism
,
the
ESM
.

Sulik
said
on
Sunday
he
was
sticking
by
his
demand
for
a
body
that
would
vote
on
each
stage
of
Slovak
EFSF
participation
.

If
SaS
does
block
approval
,
Radicova
may
choose
to
tie
a
second
ballot
to
a
vote
of
confidence
in
the
government
.

Or
she
could
go
straight
to
the
centre
-
left
opposition
Smer
party
to
secure
its
support
in
return
for
the
government
’s
resignation
.

Radicova
has
said
she
will
secure
EFSF
approval
by
Oct.
14
,
so
that
European
Union
leaders
can
discuss
it
at
a
meeting
that
starts
two
days
later
.

SaS
’s
popularity
has
risen
slightly
thanks
to
its
stance
on
Europe
,
but
polls
suggest
Slovaks
,
whose
purchasing
power
and
average
salaries
are
far
below
those
of
the
Greeks
,
are
evenly
split
.

”
said
Stefan
Matolak
,
a
35-year
-
old
sales
manager
in
the
northern
Slovak
town
of
Stara
Lubovna
.

“
We
entered
the
euro
thinking
we
’d
be
equal
partners
,
but
they
’re
living
high
on
the
hog
,
and
we
are
n’t
.

CHICAGO
(

)
-
Mikey
Welsh
,
the
former
bass
player
for
the
alternative
rock
band
Weezer
,
was
found
dead
in
a
Chicago
hotel
,
a
police
spokeswoman
said
on

Workers
at
the
Rafaello

found
Welsh
unresponsive
and

when
they
went
to
his
room
on
Saturday
afternoon
after
he

said
.

Welsh
,
40
,
who
left
the

a

,
had
been
in
Chicago
to

a

that
will
go

,
the

his
death
.

“
As
sad
as
it

It
’s
shocking
,
but
movies
are
of
secondary
concern
in
“
Life
Itself
,
”
film
critic
Roger
Ebert
’s
new
memoir
.

Yes
,
the
book
features
anecdotes
from
years
spent
churning
out
reviews
of
classics
such
as
“
Bonnie
and
Clyde
”
and
“
Boyz
‘
N
The
Hood
”
and
boasts
amusing
remembrances
of
film
greats
like
the
hard
-
drinking
Lee
Marvin
and
a
“
damned
if
I
care
”
Robert
Mitchum
.

But
readers
hoping
for
an
in
-
the
-
trenches
account
from
Ebert
’s
decades
as
one
of
the
nation
’s
taste
-
makers
will
be
disappointed
.

Instead
,
America
’s
most
famous
film
critic
offers
an
over
-
stocked
tour
through
his
early
life
as
the
only
child
of
an
electrician
,
his
struggles
with
alcoholism
,
his
love
affair
and
eventual
marriage
to
his
wife
,
Chaz
,
and
his
battle
with
cancer
—-
a
fight
that
robbed
him
of
the
ability
to
speak
,
eat
and
drink
,
while
leaving
him
,
in
his
own
words
,
looking
like
“
the
Phantom
of
the
Opera
.
”

There
are
also
odes
to
the
Chicago
-
based
fast
food
chain
Steak
‘
N
Shake
,
loving
accounts
of
travel
to
foreign
cities
such
as
London
and
Venice
,
riffs
on
secular
humanism
,
and
a
chronicle
of
lost
virginity
involving
a
prostitute
in
South
Africa
.

Even
boyhood
dog
Blackie
gets
a
chapter
.

At
the
end
of
it
,
you
’ll
know
more
about
Ebert
than
you
do
your
closest
friends
,
and
that
’s
not
always
a
good
thing
.

Though
the
prose
is
crisp
and
the
stories
,
like
Ebert
’s
best
reviews
,
glide
effortlessly
without
ever
calling
attention
to
the
writing
,
it
’s
hard
to
shake
the
feeling
that
some
of
what
’s
recounted
could
have
benefited
from
the
red
pen
and
that
the
most
interesting
bits
were
left
on
the
cutting
-
room
floor
.

”
is
generous
,
witty
,
and
warm
-
hearted
,
but
it
’s
also
a
bit
rudderless
.

Ebert
’s
unflinching
account
of
his
struggles
with
alcoholism
is
admirable
,
as
is
his
dignity
in
coping
with
the
surgeries
that
mangled
his
face
and
robbed
him
of
his
voice
,
but
the
book
takes
off
when
he
describes
his
career
critiquing
movies
.

The
emotional
high
point
is
not
when
he
finally
gives
up
the
bottle
or
accepts
his
medical
condition
,
but
in
his
loving
tribute
to
Gene
Siskel
,
his
co
-
anchor
on
a
weekly
review
series
“
Siskel
&
Ebert
:

The
tall
,
relatively
slender
,
and
private
Siskel
,
who
died
of
a
brain
tumor
in
1999
,
was
the
physical
and
temperamental
opposite
of
the
squat
,
portly
,
and
effusive
Ebert
.

Yet
the
two
shared
an
improbable
on
-
screen
chemistry
that
worked
off
-
screen
,
too
.

Part
of
the
fun
of
their
pairing
were
the
times
when
the
two
parted
ways
on
a
movie
and
would
engage
in
full
-
throated
debates
about
a
film
’s
merits
.

That
combativeness
,
Ebert
writes
,
almost
inspired
a
sitcom
about
two
rival
critics
joined
in
a
love
/
hate
relationship
,
but
both
CBS
and
Disney
ultimately
took
a
pass
on
the
pitch
.

Maybe
the
problem
was
that
no
one
else
could
possibly
understand
how
meaningless
was
the
hate
,
how
deep
was
the
love
,
”
Ebert
writes
.

Love
forms
the
spine
of
Ebert
’s
memoir
—
love
for
his
emotionally
crippling
mother
,
love
for
his
former
bar
-
mates
and
fellow
newspaper
hounds
and
love
for
Chaz
,
the
woman
who
has
been
a
guardian
angel
,
fiercely
protective
of
his
business
interests
and
his
medical
care
.

It
also
appears
,
in
an
all
-
too
-
brief
account
of
what
films
excite
Ebert
,
in
which
he
recounts
what
makes
a
memorable
film
.

He
does
n’t
have
a
precise
formula
,
mixing
in
everything
from
the
joyful
physical
movement
that
defines
“
Singing
in
the
Rain
”
to
the
great
dialogue
that
bubbles
up
during
the
first
30
minutes
of
“
White
Men

“
When
you
go
to
the
movies
every
day
,
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
the
movies
are
more
mediocre
than
ever
,
more
craven
and
cowardly
,
more
skillfully
manufactured
to
pander
to
the
lowest
tastes
instead
of
educating
them
,
”
Ebert
writes
.

Then
you
see
something
absolutely
miraculous
,
and
on
your
way
out
you
look
distracted
,
as
if
you
had
just
experienced
some
kind
of
a
vision
.

The
leaders
of
Germany
and
France
have
promised
to
unveil
new
measures
to
solve
the
euro
zone
’s
debt
crisis
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
as
international
pressure
builds
for
bold
steps
from
Europe
to
avert
an
economic
backlash
of
global
proportions
.

German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
said
after
talks
in
Berlin
on
Sunday
evening
that
their
goal
was
to
come
up
with
a
sustainable
answer
for
Greece
’s
woes
,
agree
how
to
recapitalise
European
banks
and
present
a
plan
for
accelerating
economic
coordination
in
the
euro
zone
by
a
G20
summit
in
Cannes
on
November
3
-
4
.

But
they
declined
to
reveal
any
details
of
their
plan
.

As
they
met
,
British
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
urged
them
to
take
a
“
big
bazooka
”
approach
to
the
crisis
,
telling
the
Financial
Times
that
euro
zone
leaders
had
to
break
their
cycle
of
doing
“
a
bit
too
little
,
a
bit
too
late
.
”

Merkel
and
Sarkozy
were
due
to
hold
a
working
dinner
after
their
news
conference
.

“
We
are
very
conscious
that
France
and
Germany
have
a
particular
responsibility
for
stabilising
the
euro
,
”
Sarkozy
said
,
standing
next
to
Merkel
.

“
We
need
to
deliver
a
response
that
is
sustainable
and
comprehensive
.

We
have
decided
to
provide
this
response
by
the
end
of
the
month
because
Europe
must
solve
its
problems
by
the
G20
summit
in
Cannes
.

Financial
markets
were
hoping
the
meeting
of
the
euro
zone
’s
top
two
leaders
would
produce
a
breakthrough
,
and
the
lack
of
concrete
steps
could
hurt
sentiment
on
Monday
.

It
’s
great
to
see
Sarkozy
and
Merkel
talking
,
but
they
have
to
come
up
with
some
firm
conclusions
on
what
needs
to
be
done
,
”
said
Chris
Wheeler
,
an
analyst
at
Mediobanca
in
London
.

“
The
end
of
the
month
is
a
long
way
away
.

There
has
to
be
some
clarity
on
what
we
need
and
it
’s
not
coming
through
.
”

Sarkozy
will
host
the
Cannes
summit
and
is
keen
to
deliver
a
big
success
that
might
bolster
his
chances
of
winning
re
-
election
in
a
presidential
vote
next
year
.

The
French
leader
said
he
and
Merkel
were
in
“
total
agreement
”
on
the
recapitalisation
of
European
banks
,
even
though
officials
in
Paris
and
Berlin
have
made
clear
in
recent
days
that
the
countries
are
far
apart
.

Foreign
leaders
are
looking
on
in
horror
at
the
squabbling
,
fearful
the
euro
zone
crisis
could
plunge
their
own
economies
back
into
recession
.

President
Barack
Obama
on
Thursday
urged
Europe
to
“
act
fast
,
”
calling
the
crisis
the
largest
obstacle
to
a
recovery
in
the
United
States
.

Cameron
,
in
an
interview
with
the
Financial
Times
,
pressed
euro
zone
leaders
to
increase
the
firepower
of
their
440
billion
euro
rescue
fund
—

the
European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)

—
and
to
remove
all
uncertainty
about
Greece
’s
economic
future
.

The
British
leader
said
he
had
conveyed
his
concerns
that
the
currency
bloc
was
acting
too
cautiously
to
Merkel
personally
over
the
weekend
.

The
implosion
of
Belgian
lender
Dexia
,
the
first
bank
to
fall
victim
to
the
two
-
year
-
old
euro
zone
debt
crisis
,
has
added
a
sense
of
urgency
to
the
talks
.

The
prime
ministers
of
France
and
Belgium
and
the
finance
minister
of
Luxembourg
agreed
a
rescue
plan
for
Dexia
on
Sunday
.

Other
French
banks
have
also
come
under
intense
pressure
because
of
their
exposure
to
Greece
.

A
senior
banker
told
Reuters
in
Paris
that
French
politicians
were
worried
that
even
an
orderly
Greek
debt
default
could
floor
French
banks
and
were
pushing
for
action
to
bolster
capital
levels
.

Paris
wants
to
tap
the
EFSF
to
shore
up
its
banks
,
worried
that
pouring
its
own
money
into
them
could
compromise
its
coveted
triple
-
A
credit
rating
.

Officials
in
Berlin
have
made
clear
that
they
believe
the
fund
should
be
used
only
as
a
last
resort
,
when
euro
zone
member
states
do
n’t
have
the
means
to
support
their
banks
on
their
own
.

Another
area
of
contention
is
how
to
use
a
new
,
enhanced
EFSF
to
buy
sovereign
debt
—
an
issue
that
would
become
particularly
crucial
if
Greece
failed
to
secure
a
new
aid
tranche
.

Athens
is
expected
to
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
.

Inspectors
from
the
European
Commission
,
the
IMF
and
the
European
Central
Bank
—
the
so
-
called
“
troika

”
—
are
currently
assessing
whether
the
country
has
fulfilled
the
criteria
for
more
aid
.

Greece
has
repeatedly
failed
to
meet
fiscal
targets
set
out
for
it
by
the
troika
and
its
economy
has
performed
far
worse
than
predicted
.

In
addition
to
addressing
the
banks
and
Greece
,
Merkel
said
France
and
Germany
were
working
on
steps
to
boost
economic
coordination
in
the
euro
zone
and
said
their
proposals
would
necessitate
changes
to
the
bloc
’s
Lisbon
Treaty
.

Sarkozy
made
clear
,
however
,
that
Europe
needed
to
“
take
decisions
now
,
”
rather
than
announce
long
-
term
plans
that
would
take
time
to
implement
.

Changing
the
treaty
could
take
several
years
.

“
Comprehensive
,
sustainable
and
rapid
responses
before
the
end
of
the
month
.

That
is
the
result
of
this
Franco
-
German
meeting
,
”
he
said
.

German
news
agency
DPA
,
citing
financial
sources
,
reported
on
Sunday
that
euro
zone
finance
ministers
were
working
on
scenarios
involving
a
60
percent
reduction
in
Greece
’s
debt
.

for
solving
the

But
even
if
the
two
leaders
can
agree
on
a
way
forward
,
the
experience
of
the
past
two
years
has
shown
that
they
could
struggle
to
get
the
other
15
countries
in
the
euro
zone
on
board
in
a
timely
fashion
.

Pressed
by
reporters
,
both
leaders
refused
repeatedly
to
discuss
details
of
their
plan
.

Sarkozy
said

The
two
euro
zone
heavyweights
have
come
under
pressure
worldwide
to
resolve
a
crisis
which
is
roiling
markets
.

U.S.
President
Barack

on

urged
Europe
to

”
,
calling
the
common
currency
bloc
’s
crisis

World
Bank
President
Robert
Zoellick
told
German
magazine
Wirtschaftswoche
magazine
that
there
was
a
“
total
lack
”
of
vision
in
Europe
and
Germany
in
particular
needed
to
show
more
leadership
.

Following
the
news
conference
,
the
leaders
of
the
euro
zone
’s
two
biggest
economies
were
due
to
hold
a
working
dinner
at
the
Chancellery
.

The

of

agreed

plan
for
Dexia
on
Sunday
ahead
of
the
meeting
in
Berlin
.

Other
French
banks
have
come
under
intense
pressure
because
of
their
exposure
to
Greece
and
other
weak
countries
on
Europe
’s
southern
periphery
.

BNP
Paribas
and
Societe
Generale
denied
a
report
on
Sunday
that
they
could
seek
to
raise
a
combined
11
billion
euros
as
part
of
a
broader
European
recapitalisation
plan
.

Ireland
estimated
at
the
weekend
that
European
banks
may
need
more
than
100
billion
euros
(
$
135
billion
)
to
withstand
the
debt
crisis
.

The
International
Monetary
Fund
(
IMF
)
has
said
they
need
double
that
figure
.

Paris
wants
to
tap
the
euro
zone
’s
440-billion
-
euro
European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)
to
shore
up
its
banks
,
worried
that
pouring
its
own
money
into
them
could
compromise
its
coveted
triple
-
A
credit
rating
.

Officials
in
Berlin
have
made
clear
that
they
believe
the
fund
should
be
used
only
as
a
last
resort
,
when
euro
zone
member
states
do
n’t
have
the
means
to
support
their
banks
on
their
own
.

Another
area
of
contention
is
how
to
use
a
new
,
enhanced
EFSF
to
buy
sovereign
debt
—
an
issue
that
would
become
particularly
crucial
if
Greece
failed
to
secure
its
next
tranche
of
aid
.

Greece
is
expected
to
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
.

Inspectors
from
the
European
Commission
,
the
IMF
and
the
European
Central
Bank
—
the
so
-
called
“
troika

”
—
are
currently
assessing
whether
Athens
has
fulfilled
the
criteria
for
more
aid
.

“
We
are
working
closely
with
the
troika
which
is
currently
in
Greece
and
we
expect
them
to
present
a
sustainable
solution
for
Greece
that
keeps
it
in
the
euro
zone
and
also
ensures
the
financial
stability
of
the
euro
zone
,
”
Merkel
said
.

European
Commission
head
Jose
Manuel
Barroso
told
German
newspaper
Bild
at
the
weekend
that
a
Greek
default
would
have
unforeseeable
consequences
and
may
cause
the
crisis
to
spread
.

This
is
new
territory
for
us
and
we
are
discussing
solutions
which
have
not
really
been
tested
before
,
”
he
said
.

Merkel
said
France
and
Germany
were
working
on
steps
to
boost
economic
coordination
in
the
euro
zone
and
said
their
proposals
would
necessitate
changes
to
the
bloc
’s
Lisbon
Treaty
.

Sarkozy
made
clear
,
however
,
that
Europe
needed
to
“
take
decisions
now
”
,
rather
than
announce
new
long
-
term
plans
that
would
take
time
to
implement
.

Changing
the
treaty
could
take
several
years
.

“
Comprehensive
,
sustainable
and
rapid
responses
before
the
end
of
the
month
.

That
is
the
result
of
this
Franco
-
German
meeting
,
”
he
said
.

JERUSALEM
(
Reuters
)
-
Israeli
police
Sunday
said
they
arrested
a
second
suspect
following
an
arson
attack
on
a
mosque
blamed
on
a
pro
-
settler
militant
group
,
known
by
its
slogan
“
price
tag
.

Israel
named
a
special
task
force
to
investigate
last
week
’s
blaze
in
the
Israeli
Arab
village
of
Tuba
-
Zangariya
,
amid
fears
it
may
exacerbate
tensions
with
Palestinians
.

The
“
Price
-
Taggers
,
”
also
blamed
for
other
assaults
on
mosques
,
have
said
they
want
to
avenge
the
killing
of
settlers
,
and
protest
against
Israeli
efforts
to
remove
unauthorised
settlement
outposts
built
on
land
Palestinians
want
for
a
state
.

The
violence
has
coincided
with
rising
tensions
over
a
Palestinian
application
for
statehood
on
West
Bank
land
Israel
captured
in
a
1967
war
,
filed
at
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
last
month
,
despite
Israeli
and
U.S.
objections
.

The
suspect
,
an
Israeli
male
,
would
be
remanded
in
a
court
in
the
Tel
Aviv
area
Monday
morning
,
said
police
spokesman
Micky
Rosenfeld
.

Another
Israeli
,
a
West
Bank
settler
,
18
,
was
due
in
court
again
after
his
arrest
late
last
week
,
Rosenfeld
said
.

Both
“
are
suspected
of
direct
involvement
in
the
incident
,
”
Rosenfeld
said
.

Israeli
leaders
have
condemned
the
arson
and
President
Shimon
Peres
denounced
the
attacks
as
“
un
-
Jewish
.
”

Police
are
also
investigating
the
vandalism
of
Muslim
and
Christian
cemeteries
in
the
port
town
of
Jaffa
at
the
weekend
,
and
a
firebomb
attack
on
a
synagogue
in
the
same
area
.

The

remain

been

many

.

The

eked
out
a

of
around
a

to

from
$
1.3375
on

when

.

Hourly

is
found
at

1.3423

a

above
should
ease
the
downward
pressure
,
according
to

the

eased
to

off

The

A
fan
who
threw
a
hot
dog
at
Tiger
Woods
and
missed
during
Sunday
’s
final
round
of
the
Frys.com
Open
was
arrested
by
local
police
,
officials
said
.

As
Woods
lined
up
a
19-foot
birdie
putt
at
the
par
-
three
seventh
hole
,
his
16th
of
the
day
,
the
man
ran
onto
the
edge
of
the
green
at
CordeValle
Golf
Club
shouting
:

“
Tiger
,
Tiger
”
before
hurling
the
hot
dog
into
the
air
.

The
man
never
got
closer
than
40
feet
to
Woods
,
according
to
Dan
Diggins
,
the
tournament
’s
head
of
security
.

He
immediately
fell
to
the
ground
and
allowed
himself
to
be
arrested
.

He
was
then
escorted
off
the
course
.

“
I
turned
around
and
the
hot
dog
was
in
the
air
,
”
Woods
told
reporters
after
signing
off
with
a
three
-
under
-
par
68
.

I
guess
he
wanted
to
be
in
the
news
.

“
I
was
kind
of
focusing
on
my
putt
when
he
started
yelling
.

Looked
like
he
wanted
to
be
arrested
really
because
he
laid
on
the
ground
,
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
turned
his
head
.

India
’s
Arjun
Atwal
,
who
played
with
Woods
in
the
final
round
,
described
the
incident
as
one
of
the
most
bizarre
he
had
seen
on

golf
course

“
That
guy
could
have
got
shot
,
the
way
he
ran
out
with
that
hot
dog
,
”
Atwal
said
after
closing
with
a

.

The
cops
there
could
have
thought
it
was
something
else

Atwal
said
the
hot
dog
flew
across
Tiger
’s
putting

The

landed

to
be
acquired
by

for
about
C$
2.2
billion
.

The
deal
for
Calgary
,
Alberta
-
based
Daylight
is
for
C$
10.08
per

.

That
is
more
than
double
the
closing
price
of
Daylight
’s
closing
price
of
C$
4.59
on
Friday
,
but
the
company
noted
it
is
only
a
43.6
percent
premium
over
the
60-day
weighted
average
trading
price
.

Daylight
said
in
its
release
announcing
the
deal

The
purchase
“
recognizes
the
highly
attractive
asset
portfolio
and
exceptional
team
that
we
have
assembled
at
Daylight
,
”
Daylight
Chief
Executive
Officer
Anthony
Lambert
said
in
a
statement
.

A
combination
of
falling
oil
prices
and
debt
levels
has
hit
Canadian
oil
and
gas
shares
in
recent
months
as
investors
fret
that
growth
prospects
are
shriveling
.

But
this
deal
could
be
large
enough
to
face
review
under
the
Investment
Canada
Act
,
which
must
determine
if
foreign
purchases
of
domestic
firms
are
of
net
benefit
to
Canada
.

Still
,
the
energy
sector
is
considered
less
concentrated
than
the
strategic
Potash
sector
,
and
previous
foreign
takeovers
of
domestic
energy
firms
have
gone
ahead
.

Sinopec
already
owns
a
stake
in
the
huge
Syncrude
Canada
oilsands
venture
.

Daylight
said
it
expects
its
deal
,
which
is
subject
to
shareholder
approval
,
to
close
before
the
end
of
the
year

there
are

more
to
come
,
analysts

Recruitment
consultants

said
on
Monday
that
12,750
jobs
in
London
’s
financial
districts
were
created
in
the
three
months
to
September
,
or
a
17
percent
drop
on
the
third
quarter
of
2010
.

But
they
added
that
the
month
-
on

month
decline
in
new
jobs
had
slowed
recently
.

They
estimated
the
number
of
new
vacancies
in
September
was
5
percent
lower
than
in
August
.

Rival
recruiters
Morgan
McKinley
said
in
a
separate
report
that
new
job
opportunities
had
fallen
by
6
percent
in
that
same
period
.

Morgan
McKinley
added
that
the
number
of
new
roles
created
in
September
was
19
percent
lower
than
a
year
ago
.

Demand
for
regulatory
and
compliance
staff
remained
robust
,
however

Canadian
oil

Daylight
Energy
Ltd
said
on
Sunday
it
has
agreed
to
be
acquired
by
China
’s
Sinopec
International
Petroleum
Exploration
and
Production
Corp
for
about
C$
2.2
billion
.

The
deal
for
Calgary
,
Alberta
-
based
Daylight
is
for
C$
10.08
per

.

That
is
more
than
double
the
closing
price
of
Daylight
’s
closing
price
of
C$
4.59
on
Friday
,
but
the
company
noted
it
is
only
a
43.6
percent
premium
over
the
60-day
weighted
average
trading
price
.

SIPC
is
a
subsidiary
of
China
Petrochemical
Corp
and
undertakes
overseas
investments
and
operations
in
the
upstream
oil
and
gas
sector
,
Daylight
said
in
its
release
announcing
the
deal
.

The
purchase
“
recognizes
the
highly
attractive
asset
portfolio
and
exceptional
team
that
we
have
assembled
at
Daylight
,
”
Daylight
Chief
Executive
Officer
Anthony
Lambert
said
in
a
statement
.

A
combination
of
falling
oil
prices
and
debt
levels
has
hit
Canadian
oil
and
gas
shares
in
recent
months
as
investors
fret
that
growth
prospects
are
shriveling
.

The
transaction
would
mark
the
latest
energy
sector
deal
between
China
and
Canada
.

In
July
,
China
’s
top
offshore
oil
producer
,
CNOOC
Ltd
agreed
to
buy
struggling
Opti
Canada
Inc
for
$
34
million
and
$
2
billion
in
debt
.

But
this
deal
could
be
large
enough
to
face
review
under
the
Investment
Canada
Act
,
which
must
determine
if
foreign
purchases
of
domestic
firms
are
of
net
benefit
to
Canada
.

Just
under
a
year
ago
the
government
vetoed
BHP
Billiton
’s
$
38
billion
offer
for
Saskatchewan
-
based
Potash
Corp
,
only
the
second
such
veto
under
the
legislation
,
a
move
that
prompted
concern
among
international
investors
who
worried
that
Canada
was
not
‘
open
for
business’
.

Still
,
the
energy
sector
is
considered
less
concentrated
than
the
strategic
Potash
sector
,
and
previous
foreign
takeovers
of
domestic
energy
firms
have
gone
ahead
.

Sinopec
already
owns
a
stake
in
the
huge
Syncrude
Canada
oilsands
venture
.

In
April
,
China
’s
biggest
metals
trading
firm
,
Minmetals
Resources
,
said
it
had
offered
C$
6.3
billion
to
buy
Sydney
and
Toronto
-
listed
African
copper
producer
Equinox
Minerals
.

However
,
it
dropped
its
proposal
not
because
of
regulatory
issues
,
but
because
Minmetals’
offer
was
trumped
by
a
$
7.7
billion
cash
bid
by
Barrick
Gold
Corp
just
weeks
later
.

Daylight
said
it
expects
its
deal
,
which
is
subject
to
shareholder
approval
,
to
close
before
the
end
of
the
year
.

LONDON
,
Oct

(
Reuters
)
-
Britain
has
relaxed
its
visa
rules
to
combat
an
acute
shortage
of
actuaries
triggered
by
the
insurance
industry
’s
preparations
for
new
European
capital
rules
,
recruitment
firm
ReThink
Recruitment
said
on
Monday
.

The
British
government
’s
Migration
Advisory
Committee
last
month
added
actuaries
—
who
specialise
in
assessing
risk
—
to
its
list
of
shortage
occupations
,
making
it
easier
to
recruit
them
from
outside
the
European
Union
,
Rethink
said
.

Insurers
have
complained
that
a
sharp
rise
in
actuaries’
average
pay
has
inflated
the
cost
of
preparing
for
the
EU
’s
so
-
called
Solvency
II
capital
regime
,
scheduled
to
come
into
force
in
January
2013
.

According
to
ReThink
,
actuaries’
average
pay
has
risen
by
about
a
quarter
over
the
past
year
,
with
staff
at
director
level
earning
up
to
150,000
pounds
(
$
234,000
)
a
year
.

The
Association
of
British
Insurers
has
put
the
cost
of
adapting
to
Solvency
II
at
100
million
pounds
for
big
multinational
companies
,
while
the
Lloyd
’s
of
London

insurance
market
has
said
it
is
on
course
to
spend
over
250
million
pounds
.

Evidence
gathered
by
the
Migration
Advisory
Committee
suggests
there
has
been
a
30
to
40
percent
increase
in
demand
for
actuaries
,
and
newly
qualified
members
of
the
profession
now
earn
a
starting
salary
of
up
to
55,000
pounds
a

on

LONDON
,
Oct
10
(
Reuters
)
-
Rioting
in
England
over
the
summer
has
contributed
to
an
increase
in
the
number
of
wealthy
people
considering
leaving
Britain
,
a
Lloyds
TSB
International
Wealth
survey
said
on
Monday
.

The
survey
of
1,057
people
said
17
percent
of
those
with
more
than
250,000
pounds
(
$
390,424
)
of
savings
and
investments
wanted
to
move
overseas
in
the
next
two
years
,
up
from
14
percent
six
months
ago
.

Sixty
-
one
percent
of
those
actively
considering
an
overseas
move
said
crime
and
antisocial
behaviour
was
the
key
reason
to
leave
.

This
was
up
from
43
percent
and
reflected
concerns
caused
by
riots
in
London
and
other
major
cities
in
August
.

Sadly
it
seems
August
’s
riots
,
tax
increases
and
a
rising
cost
of
living
have
cast
a
pall
over
life
in
the
UK
for
some
wealthy
people
,
”
Nicholas
Boys
Smith
,
Managing
Director
of
Lloyds
TSB
International
Wealth
,
said
in
a
statement
.

“
It
may
re
-
ignite
fears
of
a
‘
wealth
drain’
from
our
economy
as
rich
people
seek
pastures
new
,
”
he
added
.

The
August
riots
,
which
led
to
several
deaths
,
were
sparked
after
police
in
London
shot
dead
a
suspected
criminal
,
who
was
said
by
his
family
to
have
been
innocent
.

Violence
broke
out
in
several
districts
of
the
British
capital
and
then
spread
to
other
cities
,
with
widespread
damage
as
shops
were
burnt
and
looted
.

ANCHORAGE
,
Alaska
(
Reuters
)
-
Two
of
three
killer
whales
that
wandered
far
up
an
Alaska
river
have
died
,
apparently
succumbing
to
stresses
associated
with
being
out
of
their
saltwater
habitat
,
federal
officials
said
on
Sunday
.

The
surviving
whale
was
seen
swimming
downriver
Saturday
toward
possible
safety
,
officials
with
the
National
Oceanic
and
Atmospheric
Administration
’s
Fisheries
Service
said
.

Biologists
were
concerned
about
the
three
whales
because
they
had
spent
three
weeks
in
southwest
Alaska
’s
salmon
-
rich
Nushagak
River
and
were
lingering
as
far
as
30
miles
upstream
from
where
the
river
flows
into
the
saltwater
of
Bristol
Bay
.

It
was
the
first
time
killer
whales
had
been
documented
lingering
far
upriver
in
any
area
of
Alaska
,
according
to
NOAA
Fisheries
officials
.

The
two
whale
deaths
were
confirmed
late
Saturday
by
a
biologist
with
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
,
NOAA
said
.

Federal
agencies
had
been
tipped
off
by
a
local
resident
who
reported
seeing
a
floating
carcass
,
and
the
biologist
who
searched
the
area
by
air
found
both
of
the
dead
whales
,
one
floating
and
one
on
the
riverbank
,
NOAA
said
.

When
last
seen
swimming
in
the
Nushagak
River
,
all
the
whales
had
a
filmy
coating
on
their
skin
,
a
sign
of
stress
.

Fresh
water
has
a
different
chemical
makeup
than
saltwater
and
prolonged
exposure
is
dangerous
for
killer
whales
,
said
Julie
Speegle
,
a
NOAA
spokeswoman
in
Juneau
,
Alaska
.

“
Saltwater
is
their
natural
habitat
,
”
she
said
.

“
They
do
often
swim
into
fresh
water
pursuing
prey
,
but
usually
they
turn
around
and
go
back
into
the
saltwater
.

A
team
of
NOAA
-
led
biologists
plan
to
conduct
necropsies
on
the
dead
whales
on
Monday
or
Tuesday
,
Speegle
said
.

Meanwhile
,
biologists
are
still
surveying
the
area
to
try
to
find
the
surviving
whale
and
,
if
necessary
,
will
consider
steps
to
shoo
it
back
into
its
saltwater
habitat
,
she
said
.

The
National
Football
League
(
NFL
)
will
consider
adding
a
second
game
in
London
to
its
regular
season
schedule
,
commissioner
Roger
Goodell
said
on
Sunday
.

Goodell
said
the
tremendous
support
the
NFL
has
enjoyed
in
London
has
opened
the
door
to
bringing
a
second
game
to
the
British
capital
next
season
.

He
made
the
comments
during
a
wide
ranging
discussion
at
a
fan
forum
ahead
of
the
Buffalo
Bills
-
Philadelphia
Eagles
game
,

The
NFL
played
its
first
regular
season
games
in
London
in
2007
.

This
season
’s
matchup
will
feature
the
Chicago
Bears
against
the
Tampa
Bay
Buccaneers
on
October
23
at
Wembley
Stadium
.

It
’s
been
tremendously
successful
,
”
Goodell
said
of
previous
games
.

We
have
sold
that
game
out
in
the
matter
of
hours
.

This
year
,
because
of
the
lockout
,
we
did
n’t
start
selling
tickets
until
mid
-
August
so
we
still
have
some
tickets
,
but
fan
reaction
has
been
overwhelmingly
positive
and
we
want
to
build
on
that
.

We
’re
going
to
talk
about
it
at
our
league
meeting
on
Tuesday
with
maybe
the
potential
of
expanding
it
to
two
games
in
London
.
”

While
Goodell
expressed
his
excitement
about
the
success
of
the
London
games
,
he
was
not
as
enthused
about
the
Bills’
contests
being
played
across
the
Canadian
border
in
Toronto
,
saying
the
fan
experience
needed
to
be
improved
.

In
an
attempt
to
expand
their
fan
base
,
the
Bills
sold
five
regular
season
games
and
three
preseason
contests
between
2008
and
2012
to
Toronto
for
$
78
million
.

But
ticket
sales
have
often
been
slow
.

“
I
think
we
can
do
it
better
and
so
do
the
Bills
and
so
do
the
(
Toronto
)
people
,
”
said
Goodell
.

“
We
want
to
try
and
make
that
better
for
the
fans
that
go
from
Buffalo
up
to
the
series
,
and
also
for
the
fans
there
in
Toronto
.

LONDON
(
Reuters
)
-
Greece
’s
debt
crisis
is
hitting
the
health
of
the
nation
hard
,
with
the
number
of
suicides
increasing
,
more
people
turning
to
drugs
and
prostitution
and
rapidly
rising
rates
of
HIV
infections
,
researchers
said
on
Monday
.

Swingeing
budget
cuts
and
growing
unemployment
are
pushing
more
people
into
severe
depression
and
drug
-
dependence
,
and
cutbacks
in
hospital
budgets
and
healthcare
services
mean
fewer
people
can
see
their
doctors
or
access
help
.

The
picture
of
health
in
Greece
is
concerning
,
”
said
David
Stuckler
,
a
sociologist
at
Britain
’s
University
of
Cambridge
who
reported
his
findings
in
the
Lancet
medical
journal
.

—
a
doubling
of
suicides
,
rising
homicides
,
a
50
percent
rise
in
HIV
infections
and
people
reporting
that
their
health
has
got
worse

but
they
’re
not
going
to
the
doctor
even
though
they
felt
they
needed
to
.

In
the
past
two
years
,
the
Greek
government
has
imposed
harsh
austerity
measures
to
deal
with
a
debt
mountain
as
the
country
plummeted
into
its
deepest
recession
in
40
years
and
was
forced
to
accept
an
EU
-
IMF
bailout
.

Greece
is
expected
to
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
.

Inspectors
from
the
European
Union
,
the
International
Monetary
Fund
and
the
European
Central
Bank

”
—
are
currently
assessing
whether
Athens
has
fulfilled
the
criteria
for
more
aid
.

In
the
meantime
,
businesses
are
shutting
down
,
the
public
sector
is
shrinking
and
unemployment
is
running
at
more
than
16
percent
.

Health
budget
cuts
have
also
led
Greece
to
slash
the
prices
it
will
pay
for
medicines
,
triggering
supply
concerns
.

Stuckler
’s
team
found
that
suicides
rose
by
17
percent
in
2009
from
2007
and
said
unofficial
data
quoted
in
Greece
’s
parliament
point
to
even
greater
rises
,
of
25
to
40
percent
.

The
data
mirror
grim
local
news
reports
.

In
tales
that
have
shocked
Athenians
,
a
former
businessman
was
reported
to
have
jumped
to
his
death
leaving
a
note
saying
the
financial
crisis
drove
him
to
it
,
and
the
owner
of
a
small
retail
firm
was
found
hanging
from
rope
tied
to
a
bridge
.

His
suicide
note
said
simply
:
“
Do
n’t
look
for
other
reasons
.

The
economic
crisis
led
me
to
this
.
”

Martin
McKee
of
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
and
Tropical
Medicine
,
who
worked
with
Stuckler
on
the
Lancet
paper
,
said
other
struggling
European
nations
should
take
note
.

The
experience
of
Greece
is
a
warning
of
what
can
happen
if
there
are
major
cuts
to
healthcare
in
the
face
of
a
recession
,
”
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

A
previous
study
by
McKee
,
Stuckler
and
others
in
July
found
suicide
rates
across
Europe
rose
sharply
in
the
two
years
to
2009
as
the
financial
crisis
drove
unemployment
up
and
squeezed
incomes
.

In
Monday
’s
paper
,
the
researchers
also
found
a
significant
increase
in
HIV
infections
in
Greece
in
late
2010
and
said
data
suggest
that
new
infections
with
the
virus
that
causes
AIDS
will
rise
by
52
percent
this
year
compared
to
last
.

Rates
of
heroin
use
rose
by
20
percent
in
2009
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
budget
cuts
in
2009
and
2010
meant
a
loss
of
a
third
of
the
country
’s
street
-
work
programs
designed
to
help
drug
addicts
and
provide
them
with
HIV
prevention
services
.

Stuckler
said
there
were
reports
of
some
drug
users
deliberately
infecting
themselves
with
HIV
,
or
human
immunodeficiency
virus
,
to
get
access
to
welfare
benefits
of
700
euros
(
$
940
)
a
month
and
faster
admission
into
drug
substitution
programs
.

Greece
has
had
a
rocky
relationship
with
pharmaceutical
companies
as
a
result
of
the
crisis
,
imposing
some
of
the
most
draconian
price
cuts
for
medicines
of
any
European
country
,
with
unpaid
bills
a
further
burden
for
pharmaceutical
companies
.

Swiss
group
Roche
has
stopped
delivering
cancer
drugs
to
some
state
-
funded
Greek
hospitals
that
have
not
paid
their
bills
,
with
patients
being
told
to
collect
medicines
from
privately
run
pharmacies
as
they
are
more
reliable
payers
.

Roche
and
other
drugmakers
have
also
been
forced
to
accept
Greek
government
bonds
instead
of
cash
for
some
outstanding
debts
—
a
move
that
is
expected
to
increase
bad
debt
provisions
,
although
Greece
accounts
for
only
around
1
percent
of
the
global
pharmaceuticals
market
.

health
problems
a
lesson
to
others

Greece
’s
debt
crisis
is
hitting
the
health
of
the
nation
hard
,
with
the
number
of
suicides
increasing
,
more
people
turning
to
drugs
and
prostitution
and
rapidly
rising
rates
of
HIV
infections
,
researchers
said
on
Monday
.

Swingeing
budget
cuts
and
growing
unemployment
are
pushing
more
people
into
severe
depression
and
drug
-
dependence
,
and
cutbacks
in
hospital
budgets
and
healthcare
services
mean
fewer
people
can
see
their
doctors
or
access
help
.

The
picture
of
health
in
Greece
is
concerning
,
”
said
David
Stuckler
,
a
sociologist
at
Britain
’s
University
of
Cambridge
who
reported
his
findings
in
the
Lancet
medical
journal
.

—
a
doubling
of
suicides
,
rising
homicides
,
a
50
percent
rise
in
HIV
infections
and
people
reporting
that
their
health
has
got
worse

but
they
’re
not
going
to
the
doctor
even
though
they
felt
they
needed
to
.

In
the
past
two
years
,
the
Greek
government
has
imposed
harsh
austerity
measures
to
deal
with
a
debt
mountain
as
the
country
plummeted
into
its
deepest
recession
in
40
years
and
was
forced
to
accept
an
EU
-
IMF
bailout
.

Greece
is
expected
to
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
.

Inspectors
from
the
European
Union
,
the
International
Monetary
Fund
and
the
European
Central
Bank

”
—
are
currently
assessing
whether
Athens
has
fulfilled
the
criteria
for
more
aid
.

In
the
meantime
,
businesses
are
shutting
down
,
the
public
sector
is
shrinking
and
unemployment
is
running
at
more
than
16
percent
.

Health
budget
cuts
have
also
led
Greece
to
slash
the
prices
it
will
pay
for
medicines
,
triggering
supply
concerns
.

Stuckler
’s
team
found
that
suicides
rose
by
17
percent
in
2009
from
2007
and
said
unofficial
data
quoted
in
Greece
’s
parliament
point
to
even
greater
rises
,
of
25
to
40
percent
.

The
data
mirror
grim
local
news
reports
.

In
tales
that
have
shocked
Athenians
,
a
former
businessman
was
reported
to
have
jumped
to
his
death
leaving
a
note
saying
the
financial
crisis
drove
him
to
it
,
and
the
owner
of
a
small
retail
firm
was
found
hanging
from
rope
tied
to
a
bridge
.

His
suicide
note
said
simply
:
“
Do
n’t
look
for
other
reasons
.

The
economic
crisis
led
me
to
this
.
”

Martin
McKee
of
the
London
School
of
Hygiene
and
Tropical
Medicine
,
who
worked
with
Stuckler
on
the
Lancet
paper
,
said
other
struggling
European
nations
should
take
note
.

The
experience
of
Greece
is
a
warning
of
what
can
happen
if
there
are
major
cuts
to
healthcare
in
the
face
of
a
recession
,
”
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

A
previous
study
by
McKee
,
Stuckler
and
others
in
July
found
suicide
rates
across
Europe
rose
sharply
in
the
two
years
to
2009
as
the
financial
crisis
drove
unemployment
up
and
squeezed
incomes
.

In
Monday
’s
paper
,
the
researchers
also
found
a
significant
increase
in
HIV
infections
in
Greece
in
late
2010
and
said
data
suggest
that
new
infections
with
the
virus
that
causes
AIDS
will
rise
by
52
percent
this
year
compared
to
last
.

Rates
of
heroin
use
rose
by
20
percent
in
2009
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
budget
cuts
in
2009
and
2010
meant
a
loss
of
a
third
of
the
country
’s
street
-
work
programmes
designed
to
help
drug
addicts
and
provide
them
with
HIV
prevention
services
.

Stuckler
said
there
were
reports
of
some
drug
users
deliberately
infecting
themselves
with
HIV
,
or
human
immunodeficiency
virus
,
to
get
access
to
welfare
benefits
of
700
euros
(
$
940
)
a
month
and
faster
admission
into
drug
substitution
programmes
.

Greece
has
had
a
rocky
relationship
with
pharmaceutical
companies
as
a
result
of
the
crisis
,
imposing
some
of
the
most
draconian
price
cuts
for
medicines
of
any
European
country
,
with
unpaid
bills
a
further
burden
for
pharmaceutical
companies
.

Swiss
group
Roche
has
stopped
delivering
cancer
drugs
to
some
state
-
funded
Greek
hospitals
that
have
not
paid
their
bills
,
with
patients
being
told
to
collect
medicines
from
privately
run
pharmacies
as
they
are
more
reliable
payers
.

Roche
and
other
drugmakers
have
also
been
forced
to
accept
Greek
government
bonds
instead
of
cash
for
some
outstanding
debts
—
a
move
that
is
expected
to
increase
bad
debt
provisions
,
although
Greece
accounts
for
only
around
1
percent
of
the
global
pharmaceuticals
market
.

’s
Cameron
urges
“
big

”
approach

The
leaders
of
Germany
and
France
have
promised
to
unveil
new
measures
to
solve
the
euro
zone
’s
debt
crisis
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
as
international
pressure
builds
for
bold
steps
from
Europe
to
avert
an
economic
backlash
of
global
proportions
.

German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
said
after
talks
in
Berlin
on
Sunday
evening
that
their
goal
was
to
come
up
with
a
sustainable
answer
for
Greece
’s
woes
,
agree
how
to
recapitalise
European
banks
and
present
a
plan
for
accelerating
economic
coordination
in
the
euro
zone
by
a
G20
summit
in
Cannes
on
Nov.
3
-
4
.

But
they
declined
to
reveal
any
details
of
their
plan
.

As
they
met
,
British
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
urged
them
to
take
a
“
big
bazooka
”
approach
to
the
crisis
,
telling
the
Financial
Times
that
euro
zone
leaders
had
to
break
their
cycle
of
doing
“
a
bit
too
little
,
a
bit
too
late
”
.

Merkel
and
Sarkozy
were
due
to
hold
a
working
dinner
after
their
news
conference
.

“
We
are
very
conscious
that
France
and
Germany
have
a
particular
responsibility
for
stabilising
the
euro
,
”
Sarkozy
said
,
standing
next
to
Merkel
.

“
We
need
to
deliver
a
response
that
is
sustainable
and
comprehensive
.

We
have
decided
to
provide
this
response
by
the
end
of
the
month
because
Europe
must
solve
its
problems
by
the
G20
summit
in
Cannes
.

Financial
markets
were
hoping
the
meeting
of
the
euro
zone
’s
top
two
leaders
would
produce
a
breakthrough
,
and
the
lack
of
concrete
steps
could
hurt
sentiment
on
Monday
.

It
’s
great
to
see
Sarkozy
and
Merkel
talking
,
but
they
have
to
come
up
with
some
firm
conclusions
on
what
needs
to
be
done
,
”
said
Chris
Wheeler
,
an
analyst
at
Mediobanca
in
London
.

“
The
end
of
the
month
is
a
long
way
away
.

There
has
to
be
some
clarity
on
what
we
need
and
it
’s
not
coming
through
.
”

Sarkozy
will
host
the
Cannes
summit
and
is
keen
to
deliver
a
big
success
that
might
bolster
his
chances
of
winning
re
-
election
in
a
presidential
vote
next
year
.

The
French
leader
said
he
and
Merkel
were
in
“
total
agreement
”
on
the
recapitalisation
of
European
banks
,
even
though
officials
in
Paris
and
Berlin
have
made
clear
in
recent
days
that
the
countries
are
far
apart
.

Foreign
leaders
are
looking
on
in
horror
at
the
squabbling
,
fearful
the
euro
zone
crisis
could
plunge
their
own
economies
back
into
recession
.

U.S.
President
Barack
Obama
on
Thursday
urged
Europe
to
“
act
fast
”
,
calling
the
crisis
the
largest
obstacle
to
a
recovery
in
the
United
States
.

Cameron
,
in
an
interview
with
the
Financial
Times
,
pressed
euro
zone
leaders
to
increase
the
firepower
of
their
440
billion
euro
rescue
fund
—

the
European
Financial
Stability
Facility
(
EFSF
)

—
and
to
remove
all
uncertainty
about
Greece
’s
economic
future
.

The
British
leader
said
he
had
conveyed
his
concerns
that
the
currency
bloc
was
acting
too
cautiously
to
Merkel
personally
over
the
weekend
.

The
implosion
of
Belgian
lender
Dexia
,
the
first
bank
to
fall
victim
to
the
two
-
year
-
old
euro
zone
debt
crisis
,
has
added
a
sense
of
urgency
to
the
talks
.

The
prime
ministers
of
France
and
Belgium
and
the
finance
minister
of
Luxembourg
agreed
a
rescue
plan
for
Dexia
on
Sunday
.

Other
French
banks
have
also
come
under
intense
pressure
because
of
their
exposure
to
Greece
.

A
senior
banker
told
Reuters
in
Paris
that
French
politicians
were
worried
that
even
an
orderly
Greek
debt
default
could
floor
French
banks
and
were
pushing
for
action
to
bolster
capital
levels
.

Paris
wants
to
tap
the
EFSF
to
shore
up
its
banks
,
worried
that
pouring
its
own
money
into
them
could
compromise
its
coveted
triple
-
A
credit
rating
.

Officials
in
Berlin
have
made
clear
that
they
believe
the
fund
should
be
used
only
as
a
last
resort
,
when
euro
zone
member
states
do
n’t
have
the
means
to
support
their
banks
on
their
own
.

Another
area
of
contention
is
how
to
use
a
new
,
enhanced
EFSF
to
buy
sovereign
debt
—
an
issue
that
would
become
particularly
crucial
if
Greece
failed
to
secure
a
new
aid
tranche
.

Athens
is
expected
to
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
.

Inspectors
from
the
European
Commission
,
the
IMF
and
the
European
Central
Bank
—
the
so
-
called
“
troika

”
—
are
currently
assessing
whether
the
country
has
fulfilled
the
criteria
for
more
aid
.

Greece
has
repeatedly
failed
to
meet
fiscal
targets
set
out
for
it
by
the
troika
and
its
economy
has
performed
far
worse
than
predicted
.

In
addition
to
addressing
the
banks
and
Greece
,
Merkel
said
France
and
Germany
were
working
on
steps
to
boost
economic
coordination
in
the
euro
zone
and
said
their
proposals
would
necessitate
changes
to
the
bloc
’s
Lisbon
Treaty
.

Sarkozy
made
clear
,
however
,
that
Europe
needed
to
“
take
decisions
now
”
,
rather
than
announce
long
-
term
plans
that
would
take
time
to
implement
.

Changing
the
treaty
could
take
several
years
.

“
Comprehensive
,
sustainable
and
rapid
responses
before
the
end
of
the
month
.

That
is
the
result
of
this
Franco
-
German
meeting
,
”
he
said
.

German
news
agency
DPA
,
citing
financial
sources
,
reported
on
Sunday
that
euro
zone
finance
ministers
were
working
on
scenarios
involving
a
60
percent
reduction
in
Greece
’s
debt
.

South
Korea
raised
domestic
gas
rates
by
5.3
percent
on
average
on
Monday
in
a
move
to
reflect
higher
import
costs
of
liquefied
natural
gas
(
LNG
)
and
help
cut
losses
in
state
-
run
Korea
Gas
Corp
(
KOGAS
)
,
the
economy
ministry
said
.

Asia
’s
fourth
-
largest
economy
,
like
other
regional
peers
,
has
been
fighting
to
tame
inflation
led
by
costlier
energy
and
commodities
,
and
had
refrained
from
increasing
utilities
charges
.

The
decision
has
been
made
to
reflect
recent
higher
import
costs
of
LNG
and
to
recoup
accumulated
account
receivable
of
Korea
Gas
Corp
as
soon
as
possible
,
”
the
ministry
said
in
a
statement
.

South
Korea
is
the
world
’s
second
largest
LNG
importer
after
Japan
,
and
the
world
’s
fifth
-
largest
crude
oil
importer
.

KOGAS
,
the
world
’s
largest
corporate
buyer
of
LNG
,
says
its
losses
resulted
from
gas
import
costs
that
are
higher
than
its
domestic
charges
.

As
of
August
this
year
,
the
loss
had
mounted
to
4.1
trillion
won
(
$
3.48
billion
)
,
according
to
the
ministry
statement
.

“
Considering
the
losses
to
recoup
,
we
found
the
hike
should
be
made
by
at
least
7.9
percent
but
decided
to
modify
the
hike
to
5.3
percent
to
help
reduce
burdens
on
common
citizens
,
”
it
said
.

The
increases
in
tariffs
apply
to
domestic
gas
rates
in
residential
,
commercial
and
industrial
consumption
,
it
added
.

South
Korean
consumer
inflation
in
September
eased
to
4.3
percent
from
a
year
earlier
,
coming
off
a
three
-
year
high
of
5.3
percent
set
in
August
.

CAIRO
(
Reuters
)
-
Christians
clashed
with
military
police
,
leaving
at
least
24
people
dead
in
Cairo
,
and
the
cabinet
called
an
emergency
meeting
for
Monday
,
vowing
the
violence
would
not
derail
Egypt
’s
first
election
since
Hosni
Mubarak
was
toppled
.

Christians
protesting
about
an
attack
on
a
church
set
cars
on
fire
,
burned
army
vehicles
and
hurled
rocks
at
military
police
who
they
said
used
heavy
-
handed
tactics
against
them
.

It
was
some
of
the
worst
violence
since
the
February
uprising
.

The
violence
casts
a
shadow
over
the
imminent
parliamentary
election
.

Voting
starts
on

November
28
with
candidates
due
to
begin
registering
during
the
week
starting
Wednesday
.

The
clashes
also
added
to
growing
frustration
among
activists
with
the
army
who
many
Egyptians
suspect
wants
to
keep
hold
of
the
reins
of
power
from
behind
the
scenes
even
as
it
hands
over
day
-
to
-
day
government
.

This
is
a
dark
day
in
the
military
’s
history
.

This
is
betrayal
,
a
conspiracy
,
murder
,
”
Magdy
el
-
Serafy
wrote
on
Twitter
where
he
and
other
Egyptians
voiced
frustration
at
the
army
’s
handling
of
the
protest
.

The
Health
Ministry
said
the
death
toll
had
reached
24
with
213
injured
,
the
official
MENA
news
agency
reported
.

It
did
not
identify
the
dead
but
state
television
had
earlier
reported
three
soldiers
were
killed
.

Prime
Minister
Essam
Sharaf
toured
the
area
near
the
state
television
building
where
clashes
erupted
,
MENA
said
,
adding
he
spoke
to
those
in
the
area
to
hear
their
accounts
of
events
.

“
What
happened
in
front
of
the
state
TV
building
is
exactly
what
happened
on
January
25
,
”
wrote
Muslim
activist
Asmaa
Mahfouz
,
referring
to
the
start
of
the
anti
-
Mubarak
uprising
.

Christians
,
who
make
up
10
percent
of
Egypt
’s
roughly
80
million
people
,
took
to
the
streets
after
blaming
Muslim
radicals
for
partially
demolishing
a
church
in
Aswan
province
last
week
.

They
also
demanded
the
sacking
of
the
province
’s
governor
for
failing
to
protect
the
building
.

Tensions
between
Christians
and
Muslims
have
increased
since
the
uprising
.

But
Muslim
and
Christian
activists
said
the
violence
Sunday
was
not
due
to
sectarian
differences
but
was
directed
at
the
army
’s
handling
of
the
protest
.

Instead
of
advancing
to
build
a
modern
state
of
democratic
principles
,
we
are
back
searching
for
security
and
stability
,
worrying
that
there
are
hidden
hands
,
both
domestic
and
foreign
,
seeking
to
obstruct
the
will
of
Egyptians
in
establishing
a
democracy
,
”
Sharaf
said
on
state
television
.

“
We
will
not
surrender
to
these
malicious
conspiracies
and
we
will
not
accept
reverting
back
,
”
he
said
in
his
address
.

The
cabinet
said
in
a
statement
that
it
would
“
not
let
any
group
manipulate
the
issue
of
national
unity
in
Egypt
or
delay
the
process
of
democratic
transformation

”
which
it
said

TUNIS
(
Reuters
)
-
Police
in
Tunis
used
teargas
on
Sunday
to
disperse
hundreds
of
Islamists
attacking
them
with
stones
,
knives
and
batons
,
the
biggest
clashes
over
religion
in
the
Tunisian
capital
for
several
years
.

Tension
is
mounting
before
an
election
later
this
month
,
the
first
since
a
revolution
toppled
Tunisia
’s
autocratic
leader
,
that
will
pit
Islamists
free
to
express
their
beliefs
for
the
first
time
against
secularists
who
say
their
liberal
values
are
under
threat
.

The
Islamists
were
protesting
against
a
ban
on
women
who
wear
the
niqab
,
or
full
-
face
veil
,
enrolling
in
university
,
and
the
decision
by
a
Tunisian
television
station
to
broadcast
animated
film
“
Persepolis
”
which
they
said
denigrated
Islam
.

Several
hundred
protesters
gathered
outside
the
main
university
campus
in
Tunis
,
and
from
there
went
to
the
working
-
class
neighbourhood
of
Jebel
El
-
Ahmar
,
north
of
the
city
center
,
where
the
clashes
with
police
broke
out
.

About
100
police
vehicles
,
and
several
hundred
police
officers
wearing
anti
-
riot
gear
were
deployed
.

A
Reuters
reporter
said
he
saw
officers
running
to
escape
the
protesters
.

The
mainly
young
protesters
blocked
a
main
road
and
threw
stones
at
vehicles
trying
to
get
through
.

(
God
is
greatest
)
and
“
We
will
die
for
Allah
!
”

Tunisians
will
vote
in
an
October
23
election
for
an
assembly
to
draft
a
new
constitution
.

The
Islamist
Ennahda
party
is
expected
to
win
the
biggest
share
of
the
vote
,
alarming
secularists
who
have
traditionally
dominated
the
ruling
elite
.

The
clashes
on
Sunday
are
“
a
very
bad
sign
for
the
holding
of
democratic
elections
,
”
analyst
Salah
Attya
told
Reuters
.

There
are
certain
sides
or
parties
which
are
pushing
for
an
explosion
of
the
situation
before
the
election
,
”
he
said
.

A
spokesman
for
the
Interior
Ministry
,
Hichem
Meddeb
,
said
the
religious
sensitivities
of
pious
Muslims
should
be
respected
but
added
:
“
People
who
are
opposed
should
react
in
a
peaceful
way
.

We
are
committed
to
defending
all
the
institutions
and
individuals
in
this
country
.
”

Tunisia
is
the
birthplace
of
the
“
Arab
Spring
”
uprisings
.

Mass
protests
in
January
ousted
president
Zine
al
-
Abidine
Ben
Ali
,
electrifying
the
Arab
world
and
helping
inspire
revolts
in
Egypt
,
Libya
,
Yemen
,
Bahrain
and
Syria
.

The
new
caretaker
government
scheduled
democratic
elections
and
allowed
Islamists
to
run
for
the
first
time
,
unleashing
a
tense
debate
about
the
role
of
religion
in
society
.

The
latest
round
of
unrest
broke
out
on
Saturday
when
Islamists
tried
to
storm
a
university
in
Sousse
,
about
150
km
(
93
miles
)
south
of
Tunis
.

Administrators
,
enforcing
a
government
ruling
,
had
refused
to
enrol
a
woman
wearing
the
niqab
.

Earlier
on
Sunday
,
Islamists
protested
outside
the
offices
of
the
private
Nessma
television
station
in
the
center
of
Tunis
.

The
station
angered
some
conservative
Muslims
by
broadcasting
“
Persepolis
,
”
an
award
-
winning
film
based
on
an
account
of
a
woman
growing
up
in
Iran
under
strict
religious
rule
following
the
1979
Islamic
revolution
.

Witnesses
told
Reuters
about
300
protesters
,
some
with
sticks
and
knives
,
tried
to
set
fire
to
the
television
station
but
were
prevented
from
doing
so
by
a
large
number
of
police
.

At
least
40
people
were
arrested
,
the
witnesses
said
.

Ennahda
,
a
moderate
group
which
says
it
respects
women
’s
rights
and
does
not
want
to
impose
its
religious
values
on
Tunisian
society
,
condemned
Sunday
’s
violence
.

“
I
am
against
infringing
on
the
sentiments
of
people
and
their
religion
,
but
that
does
not
stop
us
being
completely
against
violence
,
whatever
form
it
is
in
,

”
said
an
Ennahda
official
,
Ali
Larayad
.

We
are
in
favor
of
peaceful
protests
to
demand
rights
and
on
principle
we
condemn
violence
.
”

Seoul
shares
are
expected
to
open
higher
on
Monday
after
encouraging
U.S.
job
data
and
amid
hopes
that
Europe
is
dealing
with
deal
crisis
,
analysts
said
.

“
Market
will
probably
start
off
in
positive
territory
.

U.S.
job
data
came
out
stronger
than
expected
,
and
this

U.S.
recession
concerns
,
”
said
Kim
Seung
-
han
,
a
market
analyst
at
HI
Investment
&
Securities
.

U.S.
employers
hired
more
workers

a
top
aide

told

.

At
the
time

crisis
,
such
turmoil
on
the
global
markets
,
even
gradual
reforms
will
require
brave
decisions

-
year
term

*
Tusk
to
seek
new
coalition
with
Peasants’
Party

*
Analysts
welcome
outcome
as
sign
of
stability

Donald
Tusk
will
be
the
first
Polish
prime
minister
since
the
fall
of
communism
in
1989
to
rule
for
two
successive
terms
after
his
centre
-
right
Civic
Platform
trounced
its
rivals
in
a
parliamentary
election
.

An
exit
poll
showed
Tusk
’s
pro
-
business
party
had
won
nearly
40
percent
of
votes
in
Sunday
’s
election
,
short
of
an
absolute
majority
but
far
ahead
of
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
nationalist
-
conservative
Law
and
Justice
party
on
just
over
30
percent
.

Financial
markets
will
welcome
Tusk
’s
victory
,
which
points
to
four
more
years
of
relative
political
and
economic
stability
in
the
European
Union
’s
largest
eastern
member
state
at
a
time
of
deepening
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
.

Final
official
results
are
not
expected
until
Tuesday
evening
,
but
a
jubilant
Tusk
swiftly
claimed
victory
and
Kaczynski
conceded
defeat
.

Projections
based
on
the
exit
poll
,
conducted
by
TNS
OBOP
for
national
television
,
showed
that
PO
and
its
preferred
coalition
partner
,
the
Peasants’
Party
(
PSL
)
,
would
together
have
enough
seats
to
win
a
majority
in
the
Sejm
lower
house
.

The
leader
of
the
rural
-
based
PSL
,
Waldemar
Pawlak
,
signalled
he
was
ready
to
forge
a
new
coalition
with
Tusk
.

“
The
ruling
party
and
coalition
for
the
first
time
in
Poland
’s
post
-
communist
history
has
been
re
-
elected
and
that
shows
the
consolidation
of
democracy
in
Poland
,
”
said
Jacek
Raciborski
,
a
political
scientist
at
Warsaw
University
.

“
Only
the
low
turnout
is
worrying
,
”
he
added
.

About
one
in
two
eligible
voters
took
part
in
the
election
,
in
which
a
return
to
power
by
Kaczynski
which
would
have
threatened
relations
with
Germany
and
Russia
and
worried
investors
.

The
PAP
state
news
agency
quoted
a
senior
PO
politician
as
saying
Tusk
and
Pawlak
might
yet
fall
short
of
a
majority
and
that
Civic
Platform
might
also
try
to
lure
members
of
the
Democratic
Left
Alliance
(
SLD
)
into
a
new
coalition
.

The
SLD
,
heir
to
the
once
-
mighty
Communist
Party
,
won
a
surprisingly
poor
7.7
percent
,
according
to
the
exit
poll
,
while
Pawlak
’s
PSL
secured
8.2
percent
.

The
outgoing
coalition
has
presided
over
four
years
of
strong
economic
growth
,
steering
Poland
smoothly
through
the
2008
-
09
global
financial
crisis
without
dipping
into
recession
.

Its
victory
ends
a
string
of
defeats
for
ruling
parties
in
elections
in
EU
member
states
this
year
,
including
in
Portugal
,
Latvia
,
Denmark
and
Ireland
.

PO
has
pledged
more
cautious
reforms
aimed
at
reining
in
the
public
debt
and
budget
deficit
,
expected
to
reach
53.8
percent
and
5.6
percent
respectively
this
year
.

It
also
wants
to
continue
a
privatisation
programme
set
to
net
15
billion
zlotys
(
$
4
billion
)
for
state
coffers
in
2011
and
to
pursue
closer
ties
with
Poland
’s
EU
partners
.

Polish
President
Bronislaw
Komorowski
,
a
former
Civic
Platform
lawmaker
,
is
now
expected
to
ask
Tusk
to
form
a
government

but
he
said
he
must
first
wait
for
the
official
election
results
,
expected
on
Tuesday
evening
.

I
hope
that
it
will
be
possible
to
reduce
the
time
necessary
for
creating
the
government
...
to
a
minimum
,
”
Komorowski
said
on
Sunday
evening
.

The
result
is
a
personal
triumph
for
Tusk
,
54
,
a
pragmatic
liberal
conservative
from
near
Gdansk
on
Poland
’s

Baltic
coast
who
was
involved
in
the
Solidarity
movement
that
helped
end
decades
of
communist
rule
.

Tusk
,
whose
country
holds
the
EU
presidency
until
the
end
of
this
year
,
favours
closer
integration
with
the
rest
of
the
bloc
and
says
joining
the
euro
remains
a
strategic
goal
for
Poland
despite
the
debt
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
.

Tusk
has
good
personal
ties
with
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
has
maintained
a
cautious
rapprochement
with
Russia
,
despite
strains
over
a
plane
crash
there
last
year
that
killed
then
-
President
Lech
Kaczynski
,
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
twin
.

A
government
led
by
Kaczynski
,
62
,
would
have
been
likely
to
strain
Poland
’s
relations
with
its
two
large
neighbours
,
Russia
and
Germany
,
as
happened
when
Law
and
Justice
was
last
in
power
from

2005
to
2007
.

Kaczynski
’s
calls
for
a
halt
to
privatisation
,
for
higher
taxes
on
the
wealthy
and
for
a
more
combative
stance
in
dealings
with
the
EU
had
also
unsettled
investors
.

The
main
surprise
of
this
election
was
the
rise
of
a
new
liberal
grouping
,
Palikot
’s
Movement
,
which
the
exit
poll
showed
winning
10.1
percent
,
much
of
it
at
the
expense
of
the
former
communists
.

Janusz
Palikot
,
its
founder
,
is
a
wealthy
businessman
and
former
PO
lawmaker
whose
attacks
on
the
powerful
Roman
Catholic
Church
and
championing
of
causes
such
as
gay
rights
and
legalisation
of
soft
drugs
struck
a
chord
among
young
voters
.

Polish
Finance
Minister
Jacek
Rostowski
said
on
Sunday
he
was
ready
to
remain
in
his
post
after
his
ruling
center
-
right
Civic
Platform
won
a
parliamentary
election
,
adding
that
the
decision
would
be
for
Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
to
make
.

Rostowski
also
told
Reuters
he
stuck
with
his
ambition
to
reduce
Poland
’s
budget
deficit
to
below
3
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
next
year
,
in
line
with
promises
to
the
European
Union
.

Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
claimed
victory
in
Sunday
’s
election
after
exit
polls
showed
his
ruling
center
-
right
Civic
Platform
party
comfortably
ahead
of
its
rivals
.

I
wanted
to
thank
all
of
those
who
voted
for
us
and
those
who
did
n’t
because
we
will
be
together
bearing
responsibility
for
Poland
for
four
more
years
,
”
Tusk
said
in
a
televised
speech
to
supporters
.

”
Waldemar
Pawlak
said
on

after
an
exit
poll
showed
Tusk
’s
party
far
ahead
of
rivals
with
nearly
40
percent
of
the
vote
and
the
Peasants’
Party
with
8.2
percent
.

The
two
parties
have
been
in
a
coalition
government
since
2007
,
steering
Poland
smoothly
through
a
global
financial
crisis
without
going
into
recession
.

Polish
Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
claimed
victory
in
a
parliamentary
election
on
Sunday
and
is
expected
to
form
a
new
coalition
with
his
Peasants’
Party
allies
to
press
on
with
gradual
economic
reforms
.

*
Tusk
,
54
,
is
rated
the
most
popular
of
Poland
’s
political
party
leaders
in
opinion
polls
,
thanks
mainly
to
his
success
in
steering
the
country
relatively
safely
through
the
2008
-
09
global
financial
crisis
.

Poland
was
the
only
country
in
the
27-member
European
Union
to
avoid
recession
during
the
crisis
.

*
A
mild
-
mannered
pragmatist
with
the
common
touch
,
he
has
eschewed
radical
economic
reforms
and
has
tried
not
to
scare
Poles
with
talk
of
austerity
even
as
his
government
struggles
to
rein
in
a
large
budget
deficit
.

He
said
before
the
election
it
would
be
his
last
term
as
prime
minister
if
he
won
.

*
Tusk
’s
PO
won
the
2007
parliamentary
election
on
promises
to
pursue
liberal
market
reforms
and
improve
relations
with
Poland
’s
big
neighbors
,
Russia
and
Germany
,
and
with
the
European
Union
after
ties
with
the
bloc
became
strained
under
his
predecessor
,
the
more
nationalist
-
minded
Kaczynski
.

*
Tusk
has
disappointed
financial
markets
as
well
as
many
younger
,
more
liberal
voters
by
not
delivering
on
market
reform
.

His
government
also
proved
more
conservative
than
promised
on
social
issues
such
as
‘
in

fertilization
(
IVF
)
,
abortion
and
same

Tusk
unexpectedly
lost
the
2005
presidential
election

Lech
Kaczynski
,
Jaroslaw
’s
identical
twin
brother
who
was
killed
in
a
plane
crash
in
Russia
last
year
.

The
2005
defeat
was
a
lesson
in
humility
for
Tusk
who
learned
to
become
more
cautious
about
his
prospects
in
subsequent
elections
.

*
Tusk
,
a
historian
by

has
a
tight
grip
on
his
party
and
so
far
none
of
its
rival
factions
has
been
able
to
contest
his
position
.

He
is
also
adept
at
reacting
to
the
popular
mood
in
Poland
.

He
turns
up
in
areas
that
have
been
struck
by
natural
disasters
,
does
not
avoid
meetings
with
angry
voters
and
has

out
against

YAOUNDE
(
Reuters
)
-
Opposition
leaders
and
voters
in
Cameroon
have
complained
of
delays
at
polling
booths
and
other
organizational
shortfalls
at
a
presidential
election
expected
to
seal
a
new
term
for
incumbent
Paul
Biya
.

Accounts
that
some
voters
cast
two
ballots
while
others
did
not
vote
at
all
risk
undermining
the
credibility
of
the
poll
in
the
central
African
oil
-
producer
,
weeks
after
a
poll
in
Zambia
showed
change
through
the
ballot
box
is
possible
in
Africa
.

Sunday
’s
polling
ended
peacefully
but
power
supply
problems
meant
the
count
in
some
districts
was
conducted
by
candelight
,
the
flashlights
of
mobile
phones
or
,
as
at
one
district
in
the
capital
Yaounde
,
the
headlights
of
a
motorbike
.

Results
could
take
as
long
as
two
weeks
to
emerge
.

Some
polling
stations
opened
late
,
some
appeared
unclear
on
the
rules
about
how
votes
are
cast
,
”
Commonwealth
observer
mission
leader
Frederick
Mitchell
said
by
telephone
.

State
media
reported
that
two
gendarmes
were
killed
and
two
others
kidnapped
by
gunmen
in
the
Bakassi
peninsula
by
the
Nigerian
border
,
the
latest
in
a
spate
of
incidents
in
a
region
with
separatist
tendencies
.

However
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
wider
political
motive
.

Biya
’s
main
rival
John
Fru
Ndi
of
the
Social
Democratic
Front
(
SDF
)
said
a
surplus
of
voting
slips
meant
some
had
voted
twice
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
and
warned
election
body
Elecam
would
be
blamed
for
the
“
disorder
and
confusion
.

Casting
his
vote
,
Biya
asked
for
patience
.

“
It
(
Elecam
)
is
a
young
organization
...

I
’m
just
asking
that
there
should
be
indulgence
in
any
eventual
imperfection
.

There
was
no
intention
to
fraud
,
”
he
said
.

That
did
not
satisfy
Yaounde
resident
Samuel
Enyegueone
of
a
number
of
voters
interviewed
by
Reuters
who
said
he
had
been
unable
to
cast
his
vote
.

This
is
pure
rubbish
,
”
said
Enyegue
outside
a
polling
station
in
the
Biyem
-
Assi
district
.

I
can
not
understand
why
I
registered
but
my
name
is
not
on
the
(
voters’
)
list
.
”

After
voting
ended
,
a
Reuters
reporter
in
Yaounde
saw
19
polling
stations
where
ballots
were
being
counted
without
the
required
presence
of
candidates’
representatives
.

State
media
hailed
a
mass
turnout
but
there
was
little
evidence
of
queues
despite
the
fact
that
many
polling
stations
failed
to
open
at
8.00
am
local
(
0700
GMT
)
as
scheduled
.

It
is
a
disgrace
that
many
Cameroonians
did
not
register
and
even
the
few
who
did
would
not
come
out
to
vote
,

“
When
we
do
n’t
vote
how
do
we
ever
expect
things
to
change
?

Aside
from
its
oil
,
Cameroon
is
the
region
’s
main
maritime
entry
point
and
breadbasket
,
supplying
Chad
,
Central
African
Republic
,
Congo
Republic
and
Gabon
.

Yet
its
economic
growth
is
below
average
for
Africa
and
critics
cite
democratic
failings
.

Biya
faces
22
candidates
including
Fru
Ndi
,
and
Adamou
Ndam
Njoya
of
the
Cameroon
Democratic
Union
(
UDC
)
.

In
the
last
election
in
2004
,
Biya
scored
just
over
70
percent
,
while
his
closest
rival
,
Fru
Ndi
,
took
17
percent
.

In
2008
a
move
by
Biya
to
scrap
term
limits
,
and
anger
over
food
prices
,
led
to
street
protests
in
which
more
than
100
people
died
,
but
for
most
of
the
past
three
decades
it
has
seen
relative
stability
in
a
turbulent
region
.

However
,
one
issue
which
has
not
gone
away
is
a
separatist
movement
in
the
south
and
last
week
security
forces
detained
more
than
200
people
after
they
held
a
banned
rally
calling
for
the
right
to
secede

WARSAW
(
Reuters
)
-
Victory
for
Polish
Prime
Minister
Donald
Tusk
’s
ruling
center
-
right
Civic
Platform
(
PO
)
in
Sunday
’s
election
brings
relief
to
jittery
financial
markets
but
they
will
soon
demand
action
on
cutting
the
budget
deficit
and
debt
.

Tusk
’s
PO
won
nearly
40
percent
of
the
vote
,
exit
polls
showed
,
many
more
than
its
nearest
rival
,
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
nationalist
-
conservative
Law
and
Justice
party
,
and
is
expected
to
renew
its
coalition
with
the
small
Peasants’
Party
.

Tusk
swiftly
claimed
victory
and
Kaczynski
conceded
defeat
,
though
final
results
are
not
expected
until
Tuesday
evening
.

“
The
markets
will
treat
this
result
as
another
feather
in
Poland
’s
cap
,
”
said
Nicholas
Spiro
,
head
of
the
London
-
based
consultancy
Spiro
Sovereign
Strategy
.

This
is
a
vote
for
stability
more
than
anything
else
.

It
is
a
vote
for
gradual
and
uninspiring
reforms
.

From
a
market
standpoint
,
one
of
the
key
anchors
of
Poland
’s
creditworthiness
has
remained
in
place
.
”

“
Whether
this
results
in
the
kind
of
fiscal
and
structural
reforms
Poland
needs
is
debatable
given
PO
’s
preference
for
caution
,
”
he
added
.

Tusk
’s
government
steered
Poland
smoothly
through
the
2008
-
09
global
financial
crisis
without
dipping
into
recession
,
though
his
failure
to
press
more
radical
market
reforms
disappointed
more
liberal
supporters
.

Judging
by
the
initial
comments
of
the
Tusk
camp
Sunday
evening
,
caution
is
likely
to
remain
the
hallmark
of
the
new
government
.

At
a
time
of
global
crisis
,
such
turmoil
on
the
global
markets
,
even
gradual
reforms
will
require
brave
decisions
and
our
coalition
will
continue
to
do
them
effectively
,
”
Michal
Boni
,
an
aide
to
the
prime
minister
,
told
Reuters
.

Rating
agencies
have
warned
of
possible
downgrades
for
Poland
if
the
new
government
fails
swiftly
to
rein
in
public
debt
and
the
budget
deficit
,
though
Finance
Minister
Jacek
Rostowski
has
ruled
out
any
radical
economic
changes
in
the
event
of
a
PO
election
victory
.

Rostowski
—
who
is
expected
to
keep
his
job
in
the
new
government

—
reiterated
to
Reuters
his
plan
to
bring
the
deficit
to
below
the
EU
’s
3
percent
of
gross
domestic
product
next
year
from
an
expected
5.6
percent
in
2011
.

Many
economist
are
sceptical
that
this
can
be
done
,
especially
in
view
of
slowing
economic
growth
.

Poland
’s
economy
is
expected
to
expand
by
4
percent
this
year
but
the
IMF
and
many
banks
have
now
trimmed
back
their
forecasts
for
2012
.

But
for
now
,
markets
are
likely
to
applaud
the
election
result
,
especially
at
a
time
of
crisis
in
other
European
member
states
as
they
tackle
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
.

Investors
had
feared
a
messier
outcome
that
could
have
led
to
prolonged
political
horse
-
trading
and
a
weak
three-
or
even
four
-
party
coalition
.

They
had
also
fretted
over
a
possible
win
for
Kaczynski
,
who
favours
more
state
involvement
in
the
economy
,
higher
taxes
on
the
rich
and
an
end
to
large
-
scale
privatisations
.

From
the
point
of
view
of
the
markets
,
this
is
very
good
news
.

Investors
(
were
)
worried
that
we
could
see
a
coalition
made
up
of
three
parties
...

I
expect
a
positive
opening
,
stronger
zloty
and
a
rise
in
bond
prices
,
”
Ernest
Pytlarczyk
,
chief
economist
at
BRE
Bank
said
Sunday
.

The
zloty
has
lost
more
than
10
percent
against
the
euro
in
the
past
three
months
as
investors
flee
riskier
emerging
markets
amid
fears
over
the
global
economy
and
the
euro
zone
crisis
.

Now
everybody
will
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
new
government
and
its
main
target
is
fiscal
consolidation
and
defending
the
debt
-
to
-
GDP
ratio
below
55
percent
,
”
said
Pytlarczyk
.

The
new
government
will
want
to
prevent
debt
from
exceeding
the
55
percent
level
because
under
Polish
law
this
would
automatically
trigger
deep
spending
cuts
that
could
further
hinder
economic
growth
.

A
prominent
and
influential
Libyan
Islamist
cleric
,
returning
to

his
native
land
after
the
overthrow
of
Muammar
Gaddafi
,
has
demanded
a
role
for
“
moderate
”
Islam
in
politics
.

We
call
for
a
moderate
Islam
,
”
Ali
Al
-
Sallabi
said
at
a
meeting
late
on
Sunday
that
included
supporters
and
opponents
.

But
you
all
have
to
understand
that
Islam
is
not
just
about
punishment
,
cutting
hands
and
beheading
with
swords
.

Though
he
has
no
formal
political
role
,
Al
-
Sallabi
has
become
a
hugely
significant
voice
in
Libyan
affairs
because
he
is
close
to
the
government
of
Qatar
,
an
influential
backer
of
interim
rulers
the
National
Transitional
Council(NTC
)
.

He
also
is
a
close
associate
of
Tripoli
’s
military
commander
Abdel
Hakim
Belhadj
,
a
rising
—
and
increasingly
divisive
—

Islamist
figure
in
post
-
Gaddafi
Libya
.

Some
Libyans
,
including
several
at
the
meeting
,
suspect
that
Al
-
Sallabi
favours
introducing
a
strict
form
of
Islamic
law
,
or
sharia
,
in
a
country
that
has
long
disavowed
militant
Islam
.

Qatar
is
a
super
-
rich
nation
with
a
tiny
population
of
about
350,000
nationals
living
under
conservative
Islamic
rule
.

Its
role
in
the
region
dwarfs
its
population
,
including
giving
financial
and
military
support
to
the
war
on
Gaddafi
.

Since
the
fall
of
Tripoli
on
Aug.
23
,
Sallabi
has
emerged
as
a
prominent
spokesman
for
groups
of
Islamists
unhappy
about
what
they
see
as
attempts
by
some
NTC
leaders
to
exclude
them
from
political
life
.

It
was
not
clear
whether
he
was
back
in
Libya
permanently
or
would
return
to
his
temporary
base
in
Qatar
.

Sallabi
,
who
was
jailed
by
Gaddafi
in
the
1980s
for
opposition
activities
,
said
that
though
Islam
and
politics
could
not
be
separated
in
Libya
,
he
had
earned
his
public
voice
only
because
he
was
a
Libyan
citizen
.

“
I
believe
that
Islam
covers
all
,
including
politics
,
”
he
said
.

In
the
past
we
were
deprived
from
implementing
the
principles
of
Islam
.

I
am
a
religious
person
,
I
am
also
a
Libyan
citizen
.

I
have
my
say
with
regard
to
the
political
issue
.
”

Several
members
of
the
crowd
—
some
of
them
Islamic
scholars
—
berated
Al
-
Sallabi
,
telling
him
that
religious
leaders
had
no
place
in
politics
.

The
Islamists
are
a
political
group
that
has
used
the
religion
as
a
reference
and
turned
it
into
an
ideology
,
”
Faraj
Aby
Al
-
Esha
,
a
longtime
critic
of
Gaddafi
who
has
also
recently
returned
to
the
country
,
told
Al
-
Sellabi
.

“
The
political
game
depends
on
lies
,
conspiracies
,
and
deception
.

Forcing
religion
into
this
game
is
a
serious
issue
.
”

The
NTC
has
been
at
pains
to
assure
its
Western
allies
that
Libya
will
not
become
a
centre
of
militancy
now
that
anti
-
Islamist
leader
Gaddafi
has
gone
.

Its
leaders
say
they
will
hold
elections
and
build
a
democratic
society
,
which
though
based
on
Islamic
law
,
will
respect
civil
and
individual
rights
.

Several
Libyan
analysts
say
they
are
worried
fault
lines
are
opening
up
between
the
Islamist
-
run
Tripoli
Military
Council
,
which
has
nominal
control
over
the
city
and
is
also
believed
to
be
backed
by
Qatar
,
and
groups
loyal
to
interim
Prime
Minister
Mahmoud
Jibril
,
a
Western
-
trained
technocrat
who
Al
-
Sallabi
has
called
on
to
resign
.

Al
-
Sallabi
told
the
meeting
he
had
lambasted
Jibril
only
because
of
his
“
professional
capabilities
and
performance
”
,
not
because
he
did
not
share
his
religious
views
.

a
meeting
late
Sunday
that
included
supporters
and
opponents
.

But
you
all
have
to
understand
that
Islam
is
not
just
about
punishment
,
cutting
hands
and
beheading
with
swords
.

Though
he
has
no
formal
political
role
,
Al
-
Sallabi
has
become
a
hugely
significant
voice
in
Libyan
affairs
because
he
is
close
to
the
government
of
Qatar
,
an
influential
backer
of
interim
rulers
the
National
Transitional
Council(NTC
)
.

He
also
is
a
close
associate
of
Tripoli
’s
military
commander
Abdel
Hakim
Belhadj
,
a
rising
—
and
increasingly
divisive
—

Islamist
figure
in
post
-
Gaddafi
Libya
.

Some
Libyans
,
including
several
at
the
meeting
,
suspect
that
Al
-
Sallabi
favours
introducing
a
strict
form
of
Islamic
law
,
or
sharia
,
in
a
country
that
has
long
disavowed
militant
Islam
.

Qatar
is
a
super
-
rich
nation
with
a
tiny
population
of
about
350,000
nationals
living
under
conservative
Islamic
rule
.

Its
role
in
the
region
dwarfs
its
population
,
including
giving
financial
and
military
support
to
the
war
on
Gaddafi
.

Since
the
fall
of
Tripoli
on
August
23
,
Sallabi
has
emerged
as
a
prominent
spokesman
for
groups
of
Islamists
unhappy
about
what
they
see
as
attempts
by
some
NTC
leaders
to
exclude
them
from
political
life
.

It
was
not
clear
whether
he
was
back
in
Libya
permanently
or
would
return
to
his
temporary
base
in
Qatar
.

Sallabi
,
who
was
jailed
by
Gaddafi
in
the
1980s
for
opposition
activities
,
said
that
though
Islam
and
politics
could
not
be
separated
in
Libya
,
he
had
earned
his
public
voice
only
because
he
was
a
Libyan
citizen
.

“
I
believe
that
Islam
covers
all
,
including
politics
,
”
he
said
.

In
the
past
we
were
deprived
from
implementing
the
principles
of
Islam
.

I
am
a
religious
person
,
I
am
also
a
Libyan
citizen
.

I
have
my
say
with
regard
to
the
political
issue
.
”

Several
members
of
the
crowd
—
some
of
them
Islamic
scholars
—
berated
Al
-
Sallabi
,
telling
him
that
religious
leaders
had
no
place
in
politics
.

The
Islamists
are
a
political
group
that
has
used
the
religion
as
a
reference
and
turned
it
into
an
ideology
,
”
Faraj
Aby
Al
-
Esha
,
a
longtime
critic
of
Gaddafi
who
has
also
recently
returned
to
the
country
,
told
Al
-
Sellabi
.

“
The
political
game
depends
on
lies
,
conspiracies
,
and
deception
.

Forcing
religion
into
this
game
is
a
serious
issue
.
”

The
NTC
has
been
at
pains
to
assure
its
Western
allies
that
Libya
will
not
become
a
center
of
militancy
now
that
anti
-
Islamist
leader
Gaddafi
has
gone
.

Its
leaders
say
they
will
hold
elections
and
build
a
democratic
society
,
which
though
based
on
Islamic
law
,
will
respect
civil
and
individual
rights
.

Several
Libyan
analysts
say
they
are
worried
fault
lines
are
opening
up
between
the
Islamist
-
run
Tripoli
Military
Council
,
which
has
nominal
control
over
the
city
and
is
also
believed
to
be
backed
by
Qatar
,
and
groups
loyal
to
interim
Prime
Minister
Mahmoud
Jibril
,
a
Western
-
trained
technocrat
who
Al
-
Sallabi
has
called
on
to
resign
.

Al
-
Sallabi
told
the
meeting
he
had
lambasted
Jibril
only
because
of
his
“
professional
capabilities
and
performance
,
”
not
because
he
did
not
share
his
religious
views
.

The
Buffalo
Bills
fought
off
a
determined
Philadelphia
comeback
bid
to
claim
a
31
-
24
win
on
Sunday
and
send
the
Eagles
to
a
fourth
consecutive
defeat
.

Buffalo
cashed
in
on
Philadelphia
mistakes
scoring
touchdowns
off
two
of
quarterback
Michael
Vick
’s
four
interceptions
in
improving
their
record
to
4
-
1
.

Dubbed
the
Dream
Team
in
the
preseason
because
of
some
big
-
name
free
-
agent
signings
,
the
Eagles
have
endured
a
nightmare
start
with
their
only
victory
coming
over
winless
St.
Louis
in
their
season
-
opener
.

Once
again
,
the
Eagles
contributed
to
their
own
demise
,
particularly
in
a
sloppy
opening
half
littered
with
turnovers
,
costly
penalties
,
bad
decisions
and
poor
tackling
.

The
miscues
added
up
to
a
28
-
7
third
quarter
deficit
,
a
hole
they
were
unable
to
climb
out
as
furious
late
rally
fizzled
.

“
We
were
trying
to
confuse
Michael
,
trying
to
keep
him
off
balance
,
”
Buffalo
coach
Chan
Gailey
told
reporters
.

You
ca
n’t
sit
there
and
do
one
or
two
things
against
him
and
expect
to
slow
him
down
.

“
When
you
get
five
turnovers
and
you
do
n’t
turn
it
over
but
once
,
and
the
turnover
that
we
gave
them
,
they
ended
up
coming
out
with
nothing
right
before
the
half
...

you
get
5
-
1
(
turnover
ratio
)
,
you
give
yourself
a
great
chance
to
win
.
”

Buffalo
quarterback
Ryan
Fitzpatrick
completed
21
passes
for
193
yards
,
including
a
six
-
yard
touchdown
to
David
Nelson
.

Fred
Jackson
and
Brad
Smith
also
ran
for
scores
.

Despite
the
turnovers
it
was
a
record
breaking
afternoon
for
Vick
who
ran
for
90
yards
to
claim
the
National
Football
League
’s
quarterback
career
rushing
record
with
4,948
yards
,
eclipsing
the
old
mark
held
by
former
Philadelphia
quarterback
Randall
Cunningham
.

Vick
,
who
signed
a
six
-
year
$
100
million
deal
prior
to
the
start
of
the
season
,
completed
26-of-40
passes
for
315
yards
passing
and
touchdowns
to
LeSean
McCoy
and
Jeremy
Maclin
but
his
day
’s
work
also
included
a
career
worst
four
pickoffs
.

“
Sitting
at
1
-
4
,
there
’s
really
not
too
much
you
can
say
,
whether
you
’re
a
good
team
or
a
bad
team
,
”
said
Vick
.

As
a
quarterback
an
interception
is
an
interception
.

Regardless
of
how
you
look
at
it
,
the
world
is
going
to
judge
you
as
throwing
an
interception
.

Two
of
those
interceptions
came
is
the
opening
quarter
,
the
Bills
converting
the
first
into
a
five
-
yard
Jackson
touchdown
to
the
delight
of
a
capacity
sun
-
bathed
crowd
of
over
70,000
at
Ralph
Wilson
Stadium
.

The
Eagles
finally
got
on
the
scoreboard
early
in
the
second
,
Vick
connecting
with
a
wide
open
Maclin
for
his
100th
career
touchdown
pass
,
but
the
Bills
came
right
back
Fitzpatrick
answering
with
77-yard
drive
capped
by
a
six
-
yard
pass
to
Nelson
.

The
next
possession
,
Vick
was
off
target
again
intercepted
by
Nick
Barnett
who
returned
it
31
yards
for
a
21
-
7
Buffalo
halftime
lead
.

The
Bills
roared
out
of
the
break
,
Fitzpatrick
marching
his
team
80
yards
for
the
score
,
Smith
diving
over
from
the
five
.

Unable
to
get
much
done
with
his
arm
,
Vick
did
it
with
his
feet
scrambling
53
yards
to
set
up
a
10
yard
McCoy
touchdown
run
.

The
Bills
continued
to
cash
in
on
Philadelphia
mistakes
,
converting
a
Jason
Avant
fumble
into
a
25-yard
Rian
Lindell
field
goal
for
a
31
-
14
lead
heading
into
the
final
quarter
.

But
Eagles’
big
playmakers
began
to
step
up
in
the
fourth
,
Jackson
taking
a
short
pass
from
Vick
and
weaving
his
way
31
yards
into
the
end
zone
.

Alex
Henery
would
follow
with
a
35-yard
field
goal
with
over
nine
minutes
still
to
play
but
the
Eagles
would
get
no
closer
,
Barnett
grabbing
his
second
interception
to
snuff
out
Philadelphia
’s
last
scoring
chance
.

Donald
Tusk
will
be
the
first
Polish
prime
minister
since
the
fall
of
communism
in
1989
to
rule
for
two
successive
terms
after
his
center
-
right
Civic
Platform
trounced
its
rivals
in
a
parliamentary
election
.

An
exit
poll
showed
Tusk
’s
pro
-
business
party
had
won
nearly
40
percent
of
votes
in
Sunday
’s
election
,
short
of
an
absolute
majority
but
far
ahead
of
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
nationalist
-
conservative
Law
and
Justice
party
on
just
over
30
percent
.

Financial
markets
will
welcome
Tusk
’s
victory
,
which
points
to
four
more
years
of
relative
political
and
economic
stability
in
the
European
Union
’s
largest
eastern
member
state
at
a
time
of
deepening
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
.

Final
official
results
are
not
expected
until
Tuesday
evening
,
but
a
jubilant
Tusk
swiftly
claimed
victory
and
Kaczynski
conceded
defeat
.

Projections
based
on
the
exit
poll
,
conducted
by
TNS
OBOP
for
national
television
,
showed
that
PO
and
its
preferred
coalition
partner
,
the
Peasants’
Party
(
PSL
)
,
would
together
have
enough
seats
to
win
a
majority
in
the
Sejm
lower
house
.

The
leader
of
the
rural
-
based
PSL
,
Waldemar
Pawlak
,
signaled
he
was
ready
to
forge
a
new
coalition
with
Tusk
.

“
The
ruling
party
and
coalition
for
the
first
time
in
Poland
’s
post
-
communist
history
has
been
re
-
elected
and
that
shows
the
consolidation
of
democracy
in
Poland
,
”
said
Jacek
Raciborski
,
a
political
scientist
at
Warsaw
University
.

“
Only
the
low
turnout
is
worrying
,
”
he
added
.

About
one
in
two
eligible
voters
took
part
in
the
election
,
in
which
a
return
to
power
by
Kaczynski
which
would
have
threatened
relations
with
Germany
and
Russia
and
worried
investors
.

The
PAP
state
news
agency
quoted
a
senior
PO
politician
as
saying
Tusk
and
Pawlak
might
yet
fall
short
of
a
majority
and
that
Civic
Platform
might
also
try
to
lure
members
of
the
Democratic
Left
Alliance
(
SLD
)
into
a
new
coalition
.

The
SLD
,
heir
to
the
once
-
mighty
Communist
Party
,
won
a
surprisingly
poor
7.7
percent
,
according
to
the
exit
poll
,
while
Pawlak
’s
PSL
secured
8.2
percent
.

The
outgoing
coalition
has
presided
over
four
years
of
strong
economic
growth
,
steering
Poland
smoothly
through
the
2008
-
09
global
financial
crisis
without
dipping
into
recession
.

Its
victory
ends
a
string
of
defeats
for
ruling
parties
in
elections
in
EU
member
states
this
year
,
including
in
Portugal
,
Latvia
,
Denmark
and
Ireland
.

PO
has
pledged
more
cautious
reforms
aimed
at
reining
in
the
public
debt
and
budget
deficit
,
expected
to
reach
53.8
percent
and
5.6
percent
respectively
this
year
.

It
also
wants
to
continue
a
privatisation
programme
set
to
net
15
billion
zlotys
(
$
4
billion
)
for
state
coffers
in
2011
and
to
pursue
closer
ties
with
Poland
’s
EU
partners
.

Polish
President
Bronislaw
Komorowski
,
a
former
Civic
Platform
lawmaker
,
is
now
expected
to
ask
Tusk
to
form
a
government

but
he
said
he
must
first
wait
for
the
official
election
results
,
expected
on
Tuesday
evening
.

I
hope
that
it
will
be
possible
to
reduce
the
time
necessary
for
creating
the
government
...
to
a
minimum
,
”
Komorowski
said
on
Sunday
evening
.

The
result
is
a
personal
triumph
for
Tusk
,
54
,
a
pragmatic
liberal
conservative
from
near
Gdansk
on
Poland
’s

Baltic
coast
who
was
involved
in
the
Solidarity
movement
that
helped
end
decades
of
communist
rule
.

Tusk
,
whose
country
holds
the
EU
presidency
until
the
end
of
this
year
,
favours
closer
integration
with
the
rest
of
the
bloc
and
says
joining
the
euro
remains
a
strategic
goal
for
Poland
despite
the
debt
crisis
in
the
euro
zone
.

Tusk
has
good
personal
ties
with
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
has
maintained
a
cautious
rapprochement
with
Russia
,
despite
strains
over
a
plane
crash
there
last
year
that
killed
then
-
President
Lech
Kaczynski
,
Jaroslaw
Kaczynski
’s
twin
.

A
government
led
by
Kaczynski
,
62
,
would
have
been
likely
to
strain
Poland
’s
relations
with
its
two
large
neighbours
,
Russia
and
Germany
,
as
happened
when
Law
and
Justice
was
last
in
power
from
2005
to
2007
.

Kaczynski
’s
calls
for
a
halt
to
privatisation
,
for
higher
taxes
on
the
wealthy
and
for
a
more
combative
stance
in
dealings
with
the
EU
had
also
unsettled
investors
.

The
main
surprise
of
this
election
was
the
rise
of
a
new
liberal
grouping
,
Palikot
’s
Movement
,
which
the
exit
poll
showed
winning
10.1
percent
,
much
of
it
at
the
expense
of
the
former
communists
.

Janusz
Palikot
,
its
founder
,
is
a
wealthy
businessman
and
former
PO
lawmaker
whose
attacks
on
the
powerful
Roman
Catholic
Church
and
championing
of
causes
such
as
gay
rights
and
legalisation
of
soft
drugs
struck
a
chord
among
young
voters
.

Libyan
transitional
government
forces
attacked
deposed
leader
Muammar
Gaddafi
’s
security
headquarters
in
the
center
of
his
hometown
of
Sirte
,
hoping
that
once
the
buildings
had
been
captured
the
fight
for
the
city
would
be
won
.

The
protracted
battle
for
Sirte
,
a
showpiece
Mediterranean
coastal
city
largely
loyal
to
Gaddafi
,
has
led
to
concerns
the
many
civilian
casualties
will
breed
long
-
term
hostility
that
will
make
it
very
hard
for
the
National
Transitional
Council
(
NTC
)
to
unite
the
country
once
the
fighting
is
over
.

NTC
forces
have
repeatedly
claimed
to
be
on
the
point
of
victory
in
Sirte
,
only
to
suffer
sudden
reversals
at
the
hands
of
a
tenacious
enemy
fighting
for
its
life
,
surrounded
on
three
sides
and
with
its
back
to
the
sea
.

But
as
night
fell
Sunday
,
pick
-
up
trucks
mounted
with
anti
-
aircraft
guns
pounded
the
white
security
buildings
on
a
tree
-
lined
square
with
a
fountain
in
the
center
while
infantry
blasted
away
with
AK-47s
from
behind
a
high
concrete
wall
,
Reuters
witnesses
said
.

One
of
the
pick
-
up
gunners
was
shot
in
the
face
,
his
gun
rotating
repeatedly
on
its
axis
as
he
fell
dead
to
the
ground
.

“
We
are
now
in
the
center
of
Sirte
,
”

Colonel
Salam
Al
Shalmany
told
Reuters
at
the
scene
.

They
are
in
these
buildings
about
half
a
kilometre
from
where
we
are
.

But
advances
by
NTC
forces
have
often
proved
fragile
.

Earlier
Sunday
,
a
large
group
of
fighters
,
approaching
Sirte
from
the
west
and
trying
to
pin
down
Gaddafi
loyalists
against
the
sea
,
saw
their
advance
suddenly
collapse
into
a
rout
under
heavy
and
accurate
mortar
bombardment
.

Their
trademark
pick
-
up
trucks
raced
to
the
rear
,
some
running
on
flat
tyres
.

One
man
with
arm
and
leg
wounds
frantically
limped
away
from
the
carnage
as
commanders
screamed
over
the
radios
for
their
troops
to
pull
back
.

Soon
seven
fighters
lay
dead
in
a
field
hospital
while
dozens
more
were
being
treated
for
shrapnel
wounds
.

Elsewhere
in
the
city
,
grown
rich
on
42
years
of
Gaddafi
largesse
,
troops
and
residents
still
loyal
to
the
former
leader
launched
counter
attacks
after
losing
three
landmark
buildings
—
the
hospital
,
the
university
and
the
lavish
Ouagadougou
center
,
built
to
host
summits
of
foreign
dignitaries
.

Despite
the
counter
strikes
,
the
buildings
appeared
to
remain
in
NTC
hands
.

But
in
just
one
field
hospital
to
the
east
of
the
city
,
doctors
said
they
had
received
17
dead
and
87
wounded
in
Sunday
’s
fighting
.

NTC
chairman
Abdel
Jalil
told
a
news
conference
in
the
capital
Tripoli
that
his
men
had
reached
Sirte
city
center
and
were
combing
the
town
for
snipers

The
only
other
major
Gaddafi

held
town
,
Bani
Walid
,
in
the
desert
to
the
south
,
was
also
under
siege
from
no
fewer
than
five
sides
,
he
said
.

“
I
think
and
I
hope
,
with
the
help
of
God
,
the
liberation
of
these
two
towns
will
be
completed
by
the
end
of
this
week
.

The
prolonged
struggle
to
capture
Sirte
and
the
other
few
remaining
bastions
of
pro

Gaddafi
loyalists
has
delayed
NTC
efforts
to
set
up
effective
government
and
restart
oil
production
,
the
lifeblood
of
the
Libyan
economy
.

Sirte
holds
symbolic
significance
because
Gaddafi
turned
it
from
a
fishing
village
into
a
second
capital
.

He
built
opulent
villas
,
hotels
and
conference
halls
to
house
the
international
summits
he
liked
to
stage
there
.

Thousands
of
civilians
have
fled
Sirte
as
fighting
has
intensified
,
describing
increasingly
desperate
conditions
for
those
still
inside
the
seafront
city

There
is
no
electricity

water
and

SEOUL
,

(

-
Samsung
Electronics
Co

said
on
Monday
it
had
delayed
launching
a
new
smartphone
based
on
Google
’s
latest
version
of
Android
operating
system
due
to
the
death
of
Apple
’s
co

Jobs
death
on

long

The

also
comes
as
intensifying
legal
battle
between
Apple
and
Samsung
is
set
to
reach
the
most
crucial
moment
this
week
,
with
the

in

Samsung
has

,
the

said
.

Jobs
died
on
Wednesday
following
a
years
-
long
battle
with
pancreatic
cancer
,
and
tributes
from
world
leaders
,
business
rivals
and
fans
have
poured
in
since
.

Samsung
and
Apple
are
suing
each
other
in
10
countries
over
20
cases
since
April
,
but
few
of
them
holding
as
much
significance
as
the
California
court
ruling
on
Thursday
,
since
it
could
affect
Samsung
’s
mobile
device
sales
in
the
United
States
,
one
of
its
biggest
markets
.

Samsung
said
it
has
no
plan
to
delay
scheduled
hearing
dates
due
to
Jobs
’s
death
.

Less
than
a
day
before
his
death
on
Wednesday
,
Samsung
widened
its
patent
-
infringement
cases
with
the
U.S.
firm
to
ban
the
sale
of
Apple
’s
new
iPhone
in
France
and
Italy
after
a
series
of
setbacks
in
Australia
and
Europe
.

Apple
says
Samsung
’s
Galaxy
line
of
mobile
phones
and
tablets
“
slavishly
”
copied
its
iPhone
and
iPad
.

Samsung
rejects
the
claims
and
argue
the
U.S.
firm
infringed
on
its
mobile
patents
.

Samsung
is
the
most
credible
challenger
to
Apple
.

It
said
on
Friday
its
quarterly
profit
should
top
the
most
bullish
market
forecasts
,
with
smartphones
becoming
its
main
profit
engine
despite
intense
competition
from
bigger
rival
Apple
.

Apple
unveiled
its
latest
iPhone
last
week
,
leaving
investors
and
fans
wishing
for
more
than
a
souped
-
up
version
of
last
year
’s
device
at
a
time
of
heightened
competition
from
rival
smartphone
makers
.

But
U.S.
mobile
carrier
AT&T
said
on
Friday
it
has
seen
“
extraordinary
demand
”
for
the
new
iPhone
with
over
200,000
pre
-
orders
in
the
first
12
hours
.

Last
week
,
Apple
rejected
an
offer
from
Samsung
to
settle
a
tablet
computer
dispute
in
Australia
,
possibly
killing
off
the
commercial
viability
of
the
new
Galaxy
tablet
in
that
market
.

Samsung
is
the
biggest
maker
of

China
Nickel

said
on
Sunday
it
would
buy
an

Indonesian
iron

nickel
ore
firm
PT
Yiwan
Mining
for
HK$2.067

The

that
HK$1.907

would
be

The
actual
consideration
of
the

is
subject

that
the

could
be
as

For
the
last
few
years
,
a
widely
circulated
joke
about
Jerry
Yang
was
that
he
had
the
best
tan
in
Silicon
Valley
from
all
the
time
he
spent
on
Stanford
University
’s
golf
course
.

But
the
jests
stopped
about
six
months
ago
,
when
the
Yahoo
Inc
co
-
founder
and
former
CEO
put
away
his
golf
clubs
and
began
showing
up
on
a
daily
basis
at
the
Internet
company
’s
headquarters
in
Sunnyvale
,
California
,
according
to
a
high
-
ranking
Yahoo
executive
.

Now
,
Yang
is
interested
in
a
deal
with
private
equity
firms
that
would
take
the
$
20
billion
company
off
public
markets
,
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
situation
.

Such
a
deal
would
involve
rolling
over
Yang
’s
stake
in
Yahoo
,
which
stood
at
3.63
percent
as
of
April
2
.

Yahoo
’s
other
co
-
founder
,
David
Filo
,
would
likely
follow
Yang
’s
lead
and
roll
over
his
stake
,
said
other
sources
close
to
Yahoo
.

Filo
held
5.90
percent
of
Yahoo
’s
shares
as
of
May
11
.

Shortly
after
firing
Carol
Bartz
as
CEO
in
September
,
Yahoo
and
its
longtime
advisers
at
Allen
&
Co
and
Goldman
Sachs
began
working
on
a
strategic
review
,
which
could
include
a
sale
of
the
Internet
pioneer
,
after
receiving
unsolicited
expressions
of
interest
.

Jack
Ma
,
CEO
of
Chinese
e
-
commerce
giant
Alibaba
,
said
last
month
that
he
would
be
“
very
interested
”
in
buying
Yahoo
,
a
deal
that
could
help
the
former
English
school
teacher
expand
into
the
U.S.

Microsoft
Corp
is
also
considering
bidding
for
Yahoo
,
as
is
Silver
Lake
Partners
,
Providence
Equity
Partners
and
Hellman
&
Friedman
,
Reuters
reported
last
week
.

Another
private
firm
that
has
expressed
interest
in
Yahoo
is
Bain
Capital
,
a
source
said
.

Bain
has
invested
heavily
in
several
media
companies
including
Clear
Channel
Communications
and
The
Weather
Channel
in
recent
years
.

A
Bain
spokesman
declined
to
comment
.

Yahoo
declined
to
detail
Yang
’s
current
role
other
than
to
say
,
“
The
entire
Board
,
including
Jerry
,
is
fully
aligned
and
unanimous
in
support
of
the
comprehensive
scope
of
the
ongoing
strategic
review
.

As
always
,
Jerry
’s
singular
focus
remains
to
serve
the
best
interests
of
Yahoo
—
its
shareholders
,
employees
,
users
and
advertisers
.

Three
years
ago
,
Microsoft
offered
$
33
per
share
,
or
$
47.5
billion
,
to
acquire
Yahoo
.

Yang
and
the
board
turned
down
that
bid
,
to
the
regret
of
many
shareholders
.

Yahoo
’s
shares
closed
at
$
15.47
on
Friday
.

Now
Yang
,
who
turns
43
in
November
,
finds
himself
in
essentially
the
same
spot
—
trying
to
resuscitate
an
organization
where
a
lack
of
operational
vision
and
clear
leadership
has
made
it
susceptible
to
a
takeover
.

Yahoo
’s
share
of
the
U.S.
Internet
search
market
stood
at
16
percent
in
August
,
compared
with
19
percent
two
years
ago
,
according
to
ComScore
,
despite
a
deal
to
outsource
search
technology
to
Microsoft
.

In
contrast
,
Google
Inc
’s
search
share
has
been
steady
at
65
percent
,
while
Microsoft
’s
share
rose
to
15
percent
from
9
percent
two
years
ago
.

Yahoo
’s
U.S.
display
ad
impressions
fell
to
10.2
percent
in
June
,
and
time
spent
by
users
on
its
site
increased
just
1.6
percent
for
the
12
months
ended
July
2011
,
according
to
ComScore
.

By
comparison
,
Facebook
’s
ad
impressions
swelled
to
32.4
percent
in
June
2011
and
time
spent
by
users
on
its
site
jumped
58
percent
for
the
12
months
ended
July
2011
.

Yahoo
’s
advisors
are
expected
to
send
financial
information
this
week
to
interested
parties
,
said
a
person
familiar
with
the
matter
.

Talks
so
far
have
been
informal
and
have
not
firmed
up
on
terms
that
would
compel
Yahoo
to
enter
into
direct
negotiations
,
said
another
source
.

There
are
several
reasons
why
Yang
might
want
to
take
Yahoo
private
.

For
starters
,
Yahoo
is
punished
by
Wall
Street
for
not
being
a
growth
company
and
its
low
stock
price
prevents
shares
from
being
used
as
currency
for
acquisitions
.

A
buyer
could
sell
off
Yahoo
’s
international
assets
,
which
include
a
partnership
with
Softbank
in
Yahoo
Japan
as
well
as
about
40
percent
stake
in
Alibaba
.

The
buyer
could
then
use
the
cash
—
estimated
to
be
upward
of
$
12
billion
—
to
pay
off
debt
.

That
would
pare
down
Yahoo
to
its
U.S.
operations
,
which
has
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
they
are
being
valued
at
just
$
5
billion
and
$
6
billion
,
according
to
two
sources
close
to
the
situation
.

Whether
Yang
will
succeed
in
taking
Yahoo
private
remains
to
be
seen
—
it
depends
on
the
terms
he
manages
to
negotiate
,
as
well
as
what
other
offers
are
on
the
table
.

Yang
still
exerts
influence
over
the
board
,
but
he
has
less
clout
with
Yahoo
management
and
staff
now
than
he
did
during
the
talks
with
Microsoft
,
according
to
current
and
former
employees
.

Executives
most
loyal
to
Yang
have
matriculated
out
of
the
company
over
the
years
,
replaced
by
a
younger
generation
.

Moreover
,
some
detractors
hold
Yang
responsible
for
refusing
Microsoft
in
2008
,
saying
his
decision
was
influenced
by
his
personal
attachment
to
Yahoo
,
rather
than
financial
considerations
.

“
The
Microsoft
decision
really
split
the
company
,
with
many
feeling
that
Jerry
’s
decision
was
bad
for
them
personally
because
he
left
a
lot
of
money
on
the
table
,
”
said
a
former
executive
who
worked
at
Yahoo
at
the
time
of
the
offer
.

Nevertheless
,
Yang
still
retains
pockets
of
support
inside
the
company
.

His
supporters
say
he
has
a
deep
concern
for
the
direction
and
culture
of
the
business
he
founded
with
Filo
in
1995
.

They
praised
Yang
for
stepping
in
again
to
try
to
lift
Yahoo
’s
fortunes
at
a
difficult
juncture
,
just
as
he
did
in
2007
when
he
assumed
the
CEO
role
from
Terry
Semel
.

Yang
also
has
a
deep
network
of
contacts
in
the
industry
and
a
reputation
for
actively
working
behind
the
scenes
.

“
He
’d
be
in
the
office
,
the
door
would
be
closed
,
he
’d
be
working
the
phones
,
but
you
would
n’t
know
who
he
’d
be
working
them
with
,
”
said
another
former
Yahoo
executive
who
worked
closely
with
Yang
.

The
Business
Insider
blog
reported
in
September
that
Yang
was
trying
to
buy
Yahoo
.

Yang
,
whose
quiet
speech
and
calm
demeanor
belie
a
fiercely
competitive
streak
,
has
a
better
chance
of
remaining
involved
with
Yahoo
in
a
management
-
led
buyout
than
an
outright
sale
.

But
private
equity
firms
also
like
to
install
their
own
management
at
companies
they
acquire
.

In
pushing
a
go
-
private
agenda
,
Yang
appears
to
be
hoping
that
his
knowledge
of
Yahoo
will
be
enough
to
convince
a
buyer
to
allow
him
to
stay
on
and
try
to
restore
the
company
to
its
former
glory
,
away
from
the
harsh
eyes
of
Wall
Street
.

China
CNR
Corp
has
cancelled
plans
for
a
private
share
placement
and
will
instead
issue
new
shares
to
raise
a
much
smaller
amount
,
about
$
1.11
billion
,
the
company
said
in
a
statement
published
on
Monday
in
the
Shanghai
Securities
News
.

Under
the
terms
of
the
rights
issue
,
the
railcar
maker
will
sell
up
to
2.49
billion
new
shares
,
issuing
3
shares
for
every
10
existing
shares
,
the
company
said
.

The
company
hopes
to
raise
up
to
7.1
billion
yuan
(
$
1.11
billion
)
for
purposes
including
research
and
development
,
expanding
its
leasing
unit
and
replenishing
working
capital
.

The
amount
that
it
now
hopes
to
raise
dropped
from
10
billion
yuan
it
originally
planned
,
due
in
part
to
a
weak
stock
market
,
the
Shanghai
Securities
News
said
in
a
separate
report
.

Beijing
has
said
it
would
suspend
new
railway
project
approvals
and
launch
safety
checks
on
existing
equipment
to
address
public
anger
following
a

WINNIPEG
,
Manitoba
,
Oct
9
(
Reuters
)
-

Winnipeg
welcomed
back
its
beloved
Jets
on
Sunday
,
as
the
National
Hockey
League
returned
to
the
western
Canadian
city
15
years
after
its
heartbreaking
exit
.

The
Montreal
Canadiens
beat
the
Jets
5
-
1
in
Winnipeg
’s
first
game
of
the
NHL
regular
season
,
but
the
result
was
hardly
the
point
as
the
Manitoba
provincial
capital
reclaimed
what
it
once
lost
to
poor
economics
.

Winnipeg
’s
True
North
Sports
and
Entertainment
,
led
by
local
businessman
Mark
Chipman
and
Thomson
Reuters
Corp
chairman
David
Thomson
,
bought
the
money
-
losing
Atlanta
Thrashers
after
last
season
and
moved
them
north
to
become
Canada
’s
seventh
team
in
the
30-team
NHL
.

Derrick
Edmundson
,
55
,
watched
the
last
Jets
game
in
1996
and
did
n’t
expect
to
see
the
NHL
return
any
time
soon
after
the
team
moved
to
Phoenix
,
Arizona
to
become
the
Coyotes
.

“
To
have
them
back
in
our
generation
is
unbelievable
,
”
he
said
.

We
’re
in
the
center
of
the
hockey
universe
today
-
how
fun
is
that
?
”

Although
Winnipeg
,
population
695,000
,
was
devastated
to
lose
the
Jets
,
the
loss
was
a
turning
point
,
co
-
owner
Chipman
.

The
city
built
new
sports
facilities
and
its
manufacturing
,
farming
and
mining
economy
grew
steadily
.

I
tell
people
how
it
happened
,
”
Chipman
said
of
the
return
.

I
’m
not
sure
I
can
say
why
it
happened
.

An
enormous
number
of
good
things
happened
.

Winnipeg
sold
out
its
13,000
season
tickets
in
minutes
last
spring
in
a
frenzy
of
anticipation
.

On
Sunday
,
jersey
-
clad
fans
packed
the
MTS
Centre
arena
and
chanted
‘
Go
Jets

Go’
hours
before
the
opening
faceoff
,
while
nearby
thousands
of
fans
who
could
n’t
get
tickets
cheered
the
team
on
a
giant
TV
screen
.

“
I
think
everyone
has
taken
note
of
the
enthusiasm
and
the
passion
for
our
game
,
”
said
NHL
commissioner
Gary
Bettman
,
who
was
villified
in
Winnipeg
when
the
last
team
left
.

We
have
no
reason
to
believe
other
than
this
team
will
be
an
absolute
success
.
”

The
Canadiens
jumped
to
a
2
-
0
lead
before
Nik
Antropov
cut
the
lead
in
half
with
the
first
goal
for
the
reborn
Jets
in
the
third
period
.

Montreal
put
the
game
out
of
reach
with
three
more
goals
.

Michael
Cammalleri
and
Tomas
Plekanec
had
the
Canadiens’
first
two
goals
with
Yannick
Weber
,
Travis
Moen
and
Max
Pacioretty
scoring
after
Antropov
.

American

have
hit

before
Eagle
is

,
also
the

,

for

.

on

,
the

Flight
attendants
at
Air
Canada

have
rejected
a
tentative
labor
contract
with
the
country
’s
biggest
airline
,
and
also
served
notice
of
their
intension
to
strike
on
October
13
.

The
Canadian
Union
of
Public
Employees
(
CUPE
)
,
which
represents
6,800
flight
attendants
at
Canada
’s
biggest
airline
,
said
65.2
percent
of
its
members
who
cast
their
ballots
over
the
past
10
days
voted
against
the
agreement
.

“
We
ask
the
federal
government
,
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
,
to
respect
our
right
to
collective
bargaining
and
not
intervene
unilaterally
in
this
dispute
,
”
Jeff
Taylor
,
president
of
CUPE
’s
Air
Canada
component
,
said
in
a
statement
.

Union
leaders
had
urged
members
to
back
the
tentative
labor
agreement
,
which
was
reached
on
September
20
just
hours
before
a
strike
,
which
would
have
grounded
much
of
the
airline
’s
fleet
,
was
set
to
start
.

Union
members
overwhelmingly
rejected
a
previous
labor
contract
with
Air
Canada
in
August
.

Negotiations
resumed
after
the
rejection
but
the
union
issued
72-hour
strike
notice
when
talks
stalled
..

Canada
’s
Conservative
government
has
made
it
clear
that
it
will
step
in
swiftly
with
back
-
to
-
work
legislation
to
halt
any
strikes
at
Air
Canada
,
which
it
regards
as
an
important
engine
of
economic
activity
.

Last
month
Labour
Minister
Lisa
Raitt
said
a
strike
at
Air
Canada
could
strand
as
many
as
65,000
passengers
on
its
first
day
.

By
his
own
stated
benchmark
at
the
start
of
the
week
,
Tiger
Woods
did
not
enjoy
a
successful
Frys.com
Open
though
he
was
happy
with
his
day
-
by
-
day
progress
at
CordeValle
Golf
Club
.

Playing
in
his
first
PGA
Tour
event
in
almost
two
months
after
an
injury
-
hit
season
of
erratic
form
,
the
former
world
number
one
signed
off
with
a
three
-
under
-
par
68
in
Sunday
’s
final
round
,
his
third
successive
score
in
the
60s
.

However
,
Woods
had
said
on
the
eve
of
the
tournament
he
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
victory
in
the
second
-
tier
PGA
Tour
event
and
he
ended
the
week
in
a
tie
for
30th
,
a
distant
10
strokes
off
the
pace
.

“
I
got
better
every
day
,
”
the
14-times
major
champion
told
reporters
after
posting
a
seven
-
under
total
of
277
on
another
sun
-
splashed
day
at
CordeValle
where
the
average
score
was
69.21
in
the
final
round
.

Unfortunately
,
there
were
a
couple
of
times
where
I
kind
of
did
n’t
get
the
momentum
going
when
I
had
a
couple
of
chances
to
make
putts

“
I
felt
very
comfortable
,
and
I
just
need
to
keep
staying
the
course
.

These
are
trying
times
,
though
,
for
the
greatest
player
of
his
generation
and
arguably
the
best
ever
.

Woods
has
been
a
shadow
of
his
former
dominant
self
since
his
private
life
unravelled
at
the
end
of
2009
and
this
week
he
was
competing
for
the
first
time
in
a
Fall
Series
event
,
at
the
urging
of
U.S.
Presidents
Cup
captain
Fred
Couples
.

He
was
selected
by
Couples
as
one
of
two
wildcard
picks
on
the
12-man
team
to
take
on
the
Internationals
in
Melbourne
from
November
17
-
20
,
despite
having
played
only
eight
events
this
year
.

However
,
Woods
never
felt
he
had
to
validate
his
Cup
selection
in
this
week
’s
event
,
saying
he
was
simply
focused
on
trying
to
win
a
golf
tournament
.

“
I
’m
just
playing
to
get
competitive
,
”
said
the
35-year
-
old
American
,
who
has
not
triumphed
anywhere
since
the
2009
Australian
Masters
and
has
dropped
to
51st
in
the
rankings
.

It
’s
about
going
out
there
and
playing
...
understanding
the
situations
and
feels
,
and
game
time
’s
a
little
bit
different
.

I
really
have
n’t
played
a
whole
lot
since
the
Masters
(
in
April
)
.

For
the
second
day
in
a
row
at
CordeValle
,
Woods
made
a
strong
start
after
teeing
off
at
the
10th
,
four
birdies
in
his
first
six
holes
putting
him
five
shots
off
the
lead
at
eight
under
par
.

Though
he
bogeyed
the
par
-
three
16th
after
ending
up
in
tangly
rough
to
the
right
of
the
green
off
the
tee
,
he
birdied
the
drivable
par
-
four
17th
to
reach
the
turn
in
four
-
under
32
.

His
momentum
stalled
as
he
bogeyed
the
second
after
failing
to
reach
the
green
in
two
,
and
the
fifth
,
where
he
missed
the
fairway
badly
to
the
left
,
to
slide
back
to
six
under
.

“
I
could
have
just
really
got
it
rolling
.

I
had
a
couple
of
opportunities
like
that
,
both
yesterday
and
again
today
.

But
unfortunately
it
did
n’t
happen
that
way
.

LONDON
,
Oct
10
(
Reuters
)
-
Euro
zone
leaders
must
accept
“
collective
responsibility
”
and
take
“
decisive
steps
”
to
prevent
economic
disaster
,
British
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
said
in
an
interview
with
the
Financial
Times
on
Monday
.

He
also
called
on
France
and
Germany
to
bury
their
differences
and
to
introduce
a
decisive
plan
to
end
the
uncertainty
before
the
end
of
the
year
.

The
situation
with
the
world
economy
is
very
precarious
...

you
either
make
the
euro
zone
work
properly
or
you
confront
its
potential
failure
,
”
he
said
.

Cameron
urged
European
leaders
to
adopt
a
“
big
bazooka
”
approach
to
resolving
the
currency
crisis
,
warning
they
have
just
a
matter
of
weeks
to
avert
economic
disaster
.

German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
said
after
talks
on
Sunday
that
a
new
comprehensive
package
for
solving
the
euro
zone
debt
crisis
would
be
unveiled
by
the
end
of
the
month
.

Cameron
also
called
for
credible
stress
tests
on
Europe
’s
banks
and
said
Britain
’s
banks
,
including
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland

,
would
pass
them
“
if
they
are
properly
carried
out
”
.

“
They
need
to
be
tough
,
they
need
to
pass
the
credibility
test
.

Some
of
my
fellow
leaders
complain
that
it
’s
all
about
markets
and
speculators
,
but
none
of
us
are
proposing
to
change
the
market
system
.

He
said
the
next
stress
tests
should
be
a
model
for
sovereign
debt
writedowns
and
said
the
British
government
would
“
do
whatever
is
necessary

”
,
which
may
include
injecting
more
funds
into
RBS
to
bolster
its
core
tier
one
capital
ratio
.

Commenting
on
domestic
issues
,
Cameron
said
government
plans
to
bolster
lending
for
small
companies
can
be
worked
up
“
relatively
quickly
”
,
while
he
also
endorsed
the
Bank
of
England
’s
decision
to
restart
quantitative
easing
.

On
the
issue
of
euroscepticism
in
his
own
party
,
voiced
at
last
week
’s
Tory
conference
,
Cameron
said
EU
treaty
reform
should
not
be
on
the
“
immediate
agenda
”
,
but
added
that
he
feels
it
would
be
in
Britain
’s
interest
to
retrieve
some
powers
from
Brussels
.

Republican
White
House
hopeful
Michele
Bachmann
,
beset
by
falling
poll
numbers
,
staff
departures
and
reports
of
fundraising
troubles
,
on
Sunday
vowed
to
continue
her
campaign
through
the
New
Hampshire
primary
,
which
is
likely
to
be
in
early
January
.

Stumping
in
the
early
primary
state
for
the
first
time
since
making
her
candidacy
official
in
June
,
Bachmann
kept
up
her
attacks
on
President
Barack
Obama
and
urged
Republicans
not
to
compromise
with
a
moderate
nominee
to
oppose
him
.

A
new
poll
shows
the
Minnesota
Congresswoman
,
a
Tea
Party
favorite

for

Hampshire
after
peaking
as
high
as
second
in
June
.

Bachmann
on
Sunday
mixed
harsh
rhetoric
with
humor
as
she
campaigned
in
a
state
she
has
largely
ignored
in
favor
of
Iowa
,
which
is
seen
as
more
receptive
to
her
conservative
message
.

I
want
to
be
your
sweetheart
here
in
New
Hampshire
,
”
she
told
a
meeting
of
about
50
Tea
Party
supporters
.

“
The
thing
that
I
would
look
forward
to
more
than
anything
as
the
Republican
nominee
is
taking
Barack
Obama
on
in
the
debates
and
holding
him
accountable
for
four
years
of
destroying
the
country
.

Bachmann
also
took
a
veiled
swipe
at
Republican
frontrunner
Mitt
Romney
as
she
campaigned
in
Moultonborough
,
on
the
shores
of
Lake
Winnipesaukee
,
about
20
miles
from
Romney
’s
vacation
home
in
Wolfeboro
.

Polls
since
2009
have
given
former
Massachusetts
governor
Romney
a
wide
lead
in
the
state
among
Republican
hopefuls
.

“
It
’s
not
good
enough
to
settle
for
anyone
but
Barack
Obama
,
”
she
said
.

This
is
the
election
where
we
have
to
have
a
constitutional
conservative
.
”

Still
,
Bachmann
,
an
outspoken
evangelical
Christian
and
social
conservative
,
came
to
the
defense
of
Romney
’s
Mormon
faith
,
which
was
criticized
by
an
evangelical
pastor
at
a
conservative
conference
in
Washington
on
Friday
.

Texas
pastor
Robert
Jeffress
,
who
introduced
and
endorsed
Texas
Governor
Rick
Perry
at
the
Value
Voters
meeting
,
told
voters
to
choose
a
candidate
other
than
Romney
,
and
later
told
reporters
that
Mormonism
was
a
“
cult
.
”

“
We
do
n’t
have
a
test
for
people
when
they
go
into
the
White
House
,
”
said
Bachmann
,
who
often
espouses
her
evangelical
beliefs
while
campaigning
.

We
do
believe
in
tolerance
and
liberty
for
all
Americans
.
”

Bachmann
said
the
long
summer
debate
over
raising
the
federal
government
’s
borrowing
limit
had
kept
her
away
from
New
Hampshire
.

I
wish
I
could
have
come
back
earlier

but
I
was
fighting
the
debt
ceiling
all
summer
,
”
she
said
.

Bachmann
’s
poll
numbers
peaked
over
the
summer
in
the
run
-
up
to
her
victory
in
the
Iowa
straw
poll
,
but
have
been
falling
since
Perry
’s
entry
into
the
race
in
August
and
most
recently
with
the
rise
of
pizza
magnate
Herman
Cain
.

Since
September
her
campaign
manager
and
pollster
have
resigned
and
a
number
of
Iowa
campaign
staff
have
returned
to
her
congressional
office
staff
.

Reports
suggest
her
campaign
raised
less
than
$
5
million
in
the
third
quarter
of
the
year
,
well
below
the
levels
raised
by
Romney
and
Perry
.

The
bad
news
has
dented
the
confidence
of
even
her
core
supporters
.

“
I
’m
not
sure
Michele
has
a
great
chance
,
”
said
Don
Ewing
,
a
Tea
Party
supporter
from
Meredith
,
N.H.
,
who
said
he
was
still
deciding
whether
to
support
Bachmann
or
Cain
.

You
have
to
support
the
people
you
think
will
do
the
best
job
.

At
least
11
Chinese
sailors
were
killed
when
their
ships
were
attacked
on
the
Mekong
River
between
Thailand
and
Myanmar
,
the
Chinese
Foreign
Ministry
said
,
voicing
concern
about
what
media
reports
said
appeared
to
be
an
assault
by
drug
smugglers
.

The
sailors
were
on
two
cargo
ships
attacked
on
Oct.
5
in
the
“
Golden
Triangle
”
of
the
Mekong
,
a
region
of
Southeast
Asia
notorious
for
narcotic
production
,
the
Chinese
Foreign
Ministry
said
on
its
website
(
www.mfa.gov.cn
)
late
on
Sunday
.

As
well
as
the
11
sailors
killed
,
two
were
missing
,
said
the
ministry
.

But
officials
in
Yunnan
,
the
Chinese
province
next
to
Thailand
and
Myanmar
,
later
said
12
were
killed
and
one
was
missing
,
the
China
News
Service
said
.

Chinese
sailors
had
been
attacked
and
killed
on
the
river
before
,
it
added
,
without
giving
details
.

China
’s
growing
presence
in
Asia
,
Africa
and
other
parts
of
the
world
has
prompted
attacks
,
kidnappings
and
hijackings
,
and
the
issue
has
become
a
sensitive
one
for
Chinese
officials
,
who
do
not
want
to
appear
weak
in
protecting
nationals
.

Beijing
has
“
asked
the
countries
concerned
to
take
effective
measures
to
strengthen
protection
of
Chinese
vessels
and
crew
on
the
Mekong
River
”
,
the
Foreign
Ministry
said
.

Crew
on
another
boat
that
witnessed
the
attack
said
eight
or
so
armed
men
stormed
the
two
ships
,
and
in
the
days
since
Thai
police
have
pulled
bodies
of
the
sailors
from
the
river
,
said
the
China
News
Service
.

The
attackers
appeared
to
be
drug
smugglers
who
sought
to
use
the
seized
ships
to
traffic
narcotics
,
said
the
report
,
citing
Thai
media
accounts
.

The
Mekong
snakes
from
China
into
Southeast
Asia
,
where
it
forms
part
of
Thailand
’s
border
with
Myanmar
and
Laos
,
and
in
2001
the
four
countries
signed
an
agreement
to
regularize
shipping
on
the
river
.

The
4,900-km

Two
major
shareholders
of
New
Zealand
financial
company
Pyne
Gould
Corp
Ltd
have
made
a
$
55
million
takeover
offer
for
the
company
.

A
company
associated
with
George
Kerr
,
long
time
director
and
shareholder
,
and
U.S.
investment
fund
Baker
Street
,
have
offered
NZ$0.33
a
share
,
a
22
percent
premium
to
the
company
’s
pre
-
offer
traded
price
.

Kerr
said
the
company
has
changed
markedly
since
it
sold
assets
into
a
new
banking
company
called
Heartland
and
it
needs
to
develop
in
a
new
direction
.

“
PGC
is
now
a
company
more
likely
to
reinvest
its
earnings
in
its
assets
with
a
patient
seven
years
and
beyond
investment
horizon
,
”
Kerr
said
in
a
letter
to
shareholders
.

He
said
the
company
would
need
capital
injection
,
which
would
likely
require
calls
on
shareholders
who
have
previously
been
in
the
company
for
income
and
dividends
.

“
With
the
remaining
PGC
businesses
focusing
on
growth
rather
than
dividends
,
it
is
appropriate
to
give
all
shareholders
the
opportunity
to
sell
their
shares
for
cash
.
”

PGC
shares
gained
18.5
percent
or
5
cents
to
NZ$0.32
after
the
offer
.

The
entity
being
used
the
offer
,
Australasian
Equity
Partners
Fund
Ltd
,
said
it
already
had
undertakings
for
37.5
percent
of
the
company
.

PGC
sold
its
major
asset
,
finance
firm
Marac
into
the
Heartland
banking
operation
,
with
the
proceeds
distributed
to
shareholders
.

It
reported
a
full
-
year
loss
of
NZ$141
million
for
the
year
to
June
caused
by
restructuring
costs
involving
the
set
up
of
Heartland
,
asset
writedowns
and
weak
trading
.

It
said
it
expected
a
modest
trading
profit
this
year
.

PGC
now
holds
minor
stakes
in
agribusiness
PGW
Wrightson

,
Heartland
,
and
the
impaired
property
assets
from
Marac
.

It
said
net
asset
backing
at
June
30
was
NZ$0.60
a
share
.

A
former
Miss
Iceland
who
met
Boston
crime
boss

Whitey
”
Bulger
and
his
girl
friend
in
California
was
paid
a
$
2
million
reward
for
the
tip
that
led
to
Bulger
’s
arrest
in
June
,
the
Boston
Globe
said
on
Sunday
.

The
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
paid
the
reward
money
to
Anna
Bjornsdottir
,
a
one
-
time
model
and
Miss
Iceland
1974
who
had
gotten
to
know
Bulger
’s
girl
friend
Catherine
Greig
after
the
two
women

both
took
a
shared
interest
in
a
local
stray
cat
while
the
fugitive
couple
hid
out
in
Santa
Monica
.

Bulger
and
Greig
had
assumed
new
identities
during
more
than
a
decade
on
the
run
from
federal
charges
,
and
appeared
to
neighbors
to
be
a
modest
retired
couple
.

But
it
was
Bjornsdottir
,
the
newspaper
reported
,
who
recognized
Bulger
in
a
news
report
this
summer
while
she
was
back
in
Reykjavik
and
called
authorities
.

After
the
tip
,
Bulger
and
Greig
were
arrested
in
June
without
incident
at
their
Santa
Monica
apartment
building
in
June
.

Property
records
showed
they
moved
into
a
two
-
bedroom
unit
in
April
1998
,
playing
$
863
a
month
.

Authorities
have
said
they
found
about
30
firearms
and
$
822,000
in
cash
hidden
in
the
walls
of
their
apartment
.

The
FBI
had
said
in
September
it
had
paid
$
2.1
million
to
“
more
than
one
individual
”
for
information
that
led
to
the
arrests
of
Bulger
and
Greig
,
but
had
not
given
more
detail
.

The
newspaper
reported
Bjornsdottir
had
collected
$
2
million
of
the
$
2.1
million
in
FBI
rewards
for
her
tip
.

A
spokesman
for
the
FBI
’s
Boston
office
said
he
could
not
discuss
people
who
gave
the
bureau
information
.

Bulger
had
fled
Boston
after
hearing
from
a
corrupt
FBI
agent
that
he
was
about
to
be
indicted
.

Greig
joined
him
a
short
time
later
and
has
been
charged
with
harboring
Bulger
as
a
fugitive
.

Past
Boston
FBI
officials
had
used
Bulger
as
an
informant
for
years
against
other
organized
crime
factions
and
,
later
investigations
found
,
tolerated
or
enabled
his
own
ongoing
criminal
activities
in
what
an
appeals
court
in
a
related
case
earlier
this
year
termed
an
“
unholy
alliance
.
”

Bulger
,
who
for
years
led
the
Boston
-
based
Winter
Hill
Gang
,
faces
charges
that
include
19
alleged
murders
from
the
1970s
and
1980s
.

Both
Bulger
and
Greig
have
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
charges
against
them
.

Through
her
husband
,
Bjornsdottir
declined
to
speak
to
the
Globe
,
the
newspaper
said
.

She
had
moved
to
Southern
California
in
the
late
1970
’s
and
appeared
in
cosmetics
commercials
.

More
recently
she
had
befriended
Greig
after
noticing
her
feeding
a
local
cat
,
the
paper
reported
.

The
newspaper
described
her
currently
as
a
“
57-year
-
old
yoga
instructor
and
graphic
designer
.

The
Globe
story
also
included
many
details
of
Bulger
’s
time
on
the
run
,
including
how
Bulger
assumed
the
identity
of
a
local
homelss
man
to
obtain
medicine
and
keep
a
bank
account
.

Global
banking
regulators
will
press
ahead
with
the
first
worldwide
effort
to
force
banks
to
hold
more
liquid
assets
,
the
chairman
of
the
Basel
Committee
on
Banking
Supervision
said
in
an
interview
with
the
Financial
Times
on
Monday
.

Stefan
Ingves
,
who
also
heads
the
Swedish
central
bank
,
said
the
Basel
group
plans
to
put
uniform
implementation
of
the
Basel
III
reforms
at
the
top
of
its
agenda
.

The
measures
,
which
will
also
force
banks
to
cut
back
on
short
-
term
funding
,
have
come
under
scrutiny
from
some
of
the
27
member
countries
who
say
the
rule
changes
could
damage
the
broader
economy
.

The
reforms
,
which
were
agreed
to
by
the
member
states
,
will
force
banks
to
hold
more
top
-
quality
capital
against
unexpected
losses
,
but
there
are
rising
concerns
that
some
countries
will
not
stick
to
the
agreement
.

“
It
is
going
to
be
all
about
implementation
in
as
uniform
a
way
as
possible
.

Balkanisation
of
the
rules
over
the
long
term
is
not
in
anyone
’s
interest
,
”
Ingves
said
.

The
FT
reported
that
the
committee
plans
to
publish
“
heat
maps
”
that
show
which
countries
are
in
compliance
with
the
measures
.

The
committee
will
also
send
out
teams
of
experts
to
look
at
whether
each
country
’s
implementation
laws
and
regulations
are
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
.

The
Basel
group
is
still
hammering
out
the
details
on
two
liquidity
rules
:
the
liquidity
coverage
ratio
,
which
would
require
banks
to
hold
enough
liquid
assets
to
survive
a
30-day
crisis
;
and
the
net
stable
funding
ratio
,
which
would
force
financial
institutions
to
use
more
long
-
term
funding
.

said
the

lubricant
oil
manufacturing
unit
at
its
Negishi
refinery
near
Tokyo
caught
fire
around
6:30
p.m.

(

)
on
Sunday
,
but
was
extinguished
by

The

had
been

said
in

The

said
it
would

The

There

,
from

,
for

,
the

.

Global

will
press
ahead
with
the
first
worldwide
effort
to
force
banks
to
hold
more
liquid
assets
,
the
chairman
of
the
Basel
Committee
on
Banking
Supervision
said
in
an
interview
with
the
Financial
Times
on
Monday
.

Stefan
Ingves
,
who
also
heads
the
Swedish
central
bank
,
said
the
Basel
group
plans
to
put
uniform
implementation
of
the
Basel
III
reforms
at
the
top
of
its
agenda
.

The
measures
,
which
will
also
force
banks
to
cut
back
on
short
-
term
funding
,
have
come
under
scrutiny
from
some
of
the
27
member
countries
who
say
the
rule
changes
could
damage
the
broader
economy
.

The
reforms
,
which
were
agreed
to
by
the
member
states
,
will
force
banks
to
hold
more
top
-
quality
capital
against
unexpected
losses
,
but
there
are
rising
concerns
that
some
countries
will
not
stick
to
the
agreement
.

“
It
is
going
to
be
all
about
implementation
in
as
uniform
a
way
as
possible
.

Balkanisation
of
the
rules
over
the
long
term
is
not
in
anyone
’s
interest
,
”
Ingves
said
.

The
FT
reported
that
the
committee
plans
to
publish
“
heat
maps
”
that
show
which
countries
are
in
compliance
with
the
measures
.

The
committee
will
also
send
out
teams
of
experts
to
look
at
whether
each
country
’s
implementation
laws
and
regulations
are
in
accordance
with
the
agreement
.

The
Basel
group
is
still
hammering
out
the
details
on
two
liquidity
rules
:
the
liquidity
coverage
ratio
,
which
would
require
banks
to
hold
enough
liquid
assets
to
survive
a
30-day
crisis
;
and
the
net
stable
funding
ratio
,
which
would
force
financial
institutions
to
use
more
long
-
term
funding
.

The
Oakland
Raiders
earned
an
emotional
victory
that
would
have
delighted
late
owner
Al
Davis
as
they
beat
the
Houston
Texans
25
-
20
on
Sunday
while
the
New
Orleans
Saints
and
New
England
Patriots
also
enjoyed
wins
on
the
fifth
week
of
the
National
Football
League
season
.

The
outspoken
Davis
died
at
age
82
on
Saturday
but
the
Raiders
,
wearing
“
AL
”
stickers
on
their
helmets
,
carried
out
his
motto

”
as
Michael
Huff
grabbed
an
interception
off
Texans
quarterback
Matt
Schaub
in
the
end
zone
on
the
final
play
.

Raiders
coach
Hue
Jackson
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
on
the
sideline
while
players
embraced
each
other
as
the
game
ended
.

Davis
,
who
had
almost
50
years
with
the
Raiders
franchise
in
various
roles
,
was
remembered
with
silence
at
stadiums
across
the
country
.

“
I
know
that
he
would
be
getting
after
me
right
now
about
the
way
we
played
,
but
he
would
be
happy
because
we
won
the
game
,
”
Jackson
told
reporters
.

“
I
know
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
coach
(
Davis
)
is
up
there
somewhere
rejoicing
because
his
football
team
did
what
he
always
said
to
do
—
commitment
to
excellence
,
pride
and
poise
and
just
win
.

Once
again
Sebastian
Janikowski
was
the
spine
of
the
win
for
the
Raiders
(
3
-
2
)
,
kicking
four
field
goals
,
three
of
them
from
50
yards
or
more
.

In
an
AFC
East
divisional
clash
,
the
New
England
Patriots
,
with
BenJarvus
Green
-
Ellis
running
for
a
career
high
136
yards
and
two
touchdowns
,
beat
the
New
York
Jets
30
-
21
.

The
victory
was
the
30th
consecutive
regular
home
win
for
Patriots
quarterback
Tom
Brady
,
an
NFL
record
.

The
Carolina
Panthers
,
with
rookie
quarterback
Cam
Newton
scoring
three
touchdowns
(
one
rushing
)
and
passing
for
224
yards
,
pushed
the
Saints
all
the
way
before
losing
30
-
27
.

A
Greg
Olsen
touchdown
on
a
five
-
yard
Newton
pass
put
Carolina
up
27
-
23
in
the
fourth
but
New
Orleans
came
back
with
Drew
Brees
finding
Pierre
Thomas
open
on
the
right
for
the
winning
touchdown
with
50
seconds
to
play

Despite
another
encouraging
display
,
the
Panthers
,
who
won
just
twice
last
year
,
fall
to
1
-
4
.

The
Buffalo
Bills’
impressive
start
continued
as
they
took
advantage
of
four
interceptions
by
Philadelphia
Eagles
quarterback
Michael
Vick
in
a
31
-
24
win
.

Fred
Jackson
rushed
for
111
yards
and
a
touchdown
for
the
Bills
and
also
had
85
yards
receiving
against
an
Eagles
team
(
1
-
4
)
that
,
after
being
considered
Super
Bowl
contenders
in
the
pre
-
season
,
has
now
suffered
four
consecutive
defeats
.

The
San
Francisco
49ers
are
also
4
-
1
after
crushing
Tampa
Bay
48
-
3
.

Vernon
Davis
scored
two
touchdowns
and
Frank
Gore
rushed
for
125
yards
.

In
one
of
Sunday
’s
surprise
results
,
the
Seattle
Seahawks
enjoyed
a
36
-
25
win
at
the
New
York
Giants
.

Backup
quarterback
Charlie
Whitehurst
put
Seattle
ahead
with
a
27-yard
touchdown
pass
to
Doug
Baldwin
before
Brandon
Browner
grabbed
an
interception
on
a
pass
tip
and
ran
94
yards
for
a
score
that
put
the
game
beyond
the
Giants
.

Giants
quarterback
Eli
Manning
threw
for
420
yards
and
three
touchdowns
but
also
had
three
interceptions
.

Former
Heisman
Trophy
winner
Tim
Tebow
may
have
finally
earned
a
starting
spot
with
the
Denver
Broncos
after
the
second
-
year
quarterback
replaced
Kyle
Orton
against
San
Diego
.

Tebow
entered
in
the
third
quarter
with
the
Broncos
trailing
23
-
10
and
led
a
strong
fightback
in
the
fourth
.

He
ran
into
the
end
zone
himself
from
12
yards
and
then
found
Knowshon
Moreno
on
a
28-yard
touchdown
pass
as
Denver
pulled
within
26
-
24
.

The
Minnesota
Vikings
got
their
first
win
of
the
season
,
in
some
style
,
with
running
back
Adrian
Peterson
rushing
for
three
touchdowns
in
the
first
quarter
against
Arizona
in
a
34
-
10
victory
.

There
is
still
no
victory
for
the
Indianapolis
Colts
who
have
been
without
quarterback
Peyton
Manning
all
season
and
were
beaten
28
-
24
by
the
Kansas
City
Chiefs
.

Matt
Cassel
threw
for
four
touchdowns
and
257
yards
as
the
Chiefs
scored
21
points
unanswered
to
wipe
out
a
good
first
half
from
the
Colts
and

LONDON
,
Oct
10
(
Reuters
)
-
Lloyds
Banking
Group

appears
poised
to
take
a
loss
of
about
35
percent
on
a
1
billion
pound
(
$
1.5
billion
)
basket
of
commercial
property
debt
as
talks
advance
to
sell
the
portfolio
,
the
Financial
Times
reported
on
Monday
.

The
newspaper
cited
people
familiar
with
the
process
as
saying
as
the
bank
is
entering
second
-
round
talks
with
four
unnamed
remaining
bidders
for
the
portfolio
of
properties
.

The
sources
cited
in
the
article
say
Lloyds
narrowed
the
field
to
four
parties
on
Friday
,
each
of
which
had
tabled
initial
bids
at
almost
650
million
pounds
,
a
price
that
would
represent
a
35
percent
discount
to
the
loans’
face
values
.

Acceleration
of
the
process
means
a
sale
could
take
place
before
Christmas
,
rather
than
next
year
as
expected
,
with
Lloyds
hoping
to
unwind
the
24
billion
pounds
worth
of
bad
property
loans
it
holds
,

Moses
Mosop
of
Kenya
set
a
course
record
in
cruising
to
victory
in
the
Chicago
Marathon
on
Sunday
in
a
race
tempered
by
the
first
death
in
the
event
in
four
years
after
a
runner
collapsed
near
the
finish
line
.

The
runner
,
identified
as
William
Caviness
,
35
,
by
the
Cook
County
Medical
Examiner
’s
office
,
collapsed
about
500
yards
from
completing
the
26.2
mile
course
.

He
collapsed
within
50
yards
of
doctors
monitoring
the
race
,
who
responded
immediately
but
could
not
revive
him
and
he
was
pronounced
dead
1
hour
and
45
minutes
later
at
a
local
hospital
,
marathon
spokeswoman
Robin
Monsky
said
.

An
autopsy
has
been
scheduled
for
Monday
.

The
last
death
in
the
Chicago
Marathon
occurred
in
2007
,
when
temperatures
climbed
to
90
degrees
F
(
32
C
)
with
high
humidity
.

Some
300
runners
were
taken
to
hospital
suffering
from
heat
-
related
illness
and
the
race
was
halted
early
.

Conditions
were
milder
this
year
with
Sunday
afternoon
highs
reaching
only
73
degrees
at
a
lake
front
gauge
near
Grant
Park
where
the
race
started
and
finished
,
according
to
the
National
Weather
Service
.

Marathon
organizers
reported
transporting
54
individuals
to
area
hospitals
,
down
from
100
last
year
.

Temperatures
on
the
Chicago
lakefront
were
in
the
mid-60s
for
the
first
two
hours
of
the
race
and
did
not
reach
as
high
as
expected
through
midday
when
the
bulk
of
the
runners
were
working
their
way
through
the
city
’s
neighborhoods
.

Earlier
in
the
day
,
Mosop
surged
away
from
an
elite
field
of
runners
with
seven
miles
to
go
,
setting
a
course
record
of
two
hours
five
minutes
and
37
seconds
and
waving
to
the
crowd
as
he
trotted
toward
the
finish
line
.

Liliya
Shobukhova
of
Russia
won
the
women
’s
competition
for
the
third
straight
year
in
two
hours
eighteen
minutes
and
20
seconds
,
beating
the
second
place
women

’s
finisher
by
nearly
four
minutes
.

Both
winners’
times
were
unofficial
.

Mosop
,
who
had
the
second
fastest
marathon
time
on
record
in
losing
the
Boston
Marathon
by
4
seconds
earlier
this
year
,
quickly
countered
a
breakaway
by
countryman
Wesley
Korir
after
the
19
mile
mark
and
never
looked
back
in
breaking
the
course
record
set
two
years
ago
.

Korir
finished
38
seconds
behind
Mosop
in
second
place
.

Bernard
Kipyego
of
Kenya
was
third
.

In
a
post
-
race
interview
,
Mosop
said
he
had
been
prepared
to
challenge
for
a
course
record
,
but
not
the
world
record
because
a
leg
injury
had
limited
his
training
.

I
’m
very
happy
about
my
job
today
,
”
Mosop
said
in
the
interview
on
NBC
television
,
which
carried
the
race
.

Ryan
Hall
,
a
pre
-
race
favorite
,
finished
fifth
overall
in
2:08:04
and
was
the
top
American
.

Hall
’s
was
the
third
fastest
American
performance
on
record
for
the
Chicago
Marathon
trailing
only
Khalid
Khannouchi
’s
two
wins
in
2002
and
2000
.

The
Chicago
marathon
course
is
considered
ideal
for
record
-
setting
performances
when
conditions
are
right
.

The
route
cuts
through
two
dozen
ethnic
neighborhoods
between
its
start
and
finish
in
Grant
Park
adjacent
to
downtown
.

Mosop
had
the
second
fastest
marathon
in
history
in
Boston
at
2:03:06
,
just
behind
Geoffrey
Mutai
of
Kenya
who
set
the
marathon
record
at
2:03:02
.

Partly
because
Boston
is
a
point
-
to
-
point
course
and
there
was
a
strong
tailwind
,
those
times
were
not
recognized
as
world
records
.

The
current
world
record
in
the
marathon
is
2:03:38
,
set
September
25
in
Berlin
by
Kenya
’s
Patrick
Makau
.

Shobukhova
had
the
second
fastest
time
ever
for
a
woman
in
the
Chicago
Marathon
behind
Paula
Radcliffe
of
Great
Britain
who
set
a
then
-
world
record
of
2:17:18
in
2002
.

Ethiopian
track
star
Ejegayehu
Dibaba
,
who
was
making
her
marathon
debut
,
ran
alongside
Shobukhova
until
about
the
15
mile
mark
before
slipping
off
the
pace
.

Some
45,000
runners
were
registered
for
the
race
with
more
than
100
countries
represented
.

Race
organizers
expected
some
1.7
million
spectators
to
watch
along
the
route
.

About
35,600
runners
finished
the
race
.

SEOUL
,

(

)
-
South
Korea
’s
KDB
Financial
Group
,
a
holding
company
of
state
-
run
Korea
Development
Bank
,
is
considering
buying
HSBC
Holdings’
retail
banking
operations
in
the
country
,
sources
with
direct
knowledge
of
proposals
said
.

Two
sources
told
Reuters
on
Monday
that
KDB
had
begun
looking
into
a
possible
takeover
but
had
not
made
a
final
decision
about
whether
to
move
forward
.

Local
media
earlier
reported
that
HSBC
plans
to
sell
11
retail
branches
across
South
Korea
so
as
to
concentrate
on

corporate
and
investment
banking
businesses
.

“
It
is
hard
to
say
,
because
this
is
a
game
that
has
a
counterpart
,
”
KDB
Chairman
Kang
Man
-
soo
was
quoted
as
saying
in
an
interview
with
Yonhap
News
Agency
on
Sunday
,
referring
to
its
potential
takeover
targets
.

“
We
can
not
comment
on
media
rumours
or
speculation
,
”
said
a
Seoul
-
based
spokeswoman
at
HSBC
.

A
KDB
spokesman
declined
to
comment
.

KDB
is
on
the
lookout
for
buys
in
a
bid
to
expand
its
deposit
base
and
retail
networks
after
its
aborted
takeover
attempt
of
Woori
Finance
Holdings
.

The
London
-
based
bank
’s
planned
exit
from
retail
banking
in
Korea
comes
amid
a
revamp
plan
launched
by
new
Chief
Executive
Stuart
Gulliver
in
May
to
lift
profitability
.

HSBC
’s
Korean
retail
operations
would
be
a
nice
fit
with
KDB
,
which
is
smaller
and
has
fewer
retail
networks
compared
with
big
homegrown
lenders
such
as
Kookmin
Bank
and
Shinhan
Bank
.

In
South
Korea
,
HSBC
made
116.7
billion
won

(
$
99
million
)
in
net
profit
from

to

they

just

of

Global

appetite
again
,
especially
around
exporters
,
”
said
Lee
Kyoung
-
soo
,
an
analyst
at
Shinyoung
Securities
.

Analysts
said
stronger
-
than
-
expected
U.S.
job
data
and
progress
seen
in
Europe
were
two
factors
helping
to
buoy
sentiment
.

U.S.
employers
hired
more
workers
than
expected
in
September
and
job
gains
for
the
prior
two
months
were
revised
higher
,
data
showed
on

.

Markets
were
supported
by
news
that
the

had
promised
on

to
unveil
a
new
comprehensive
package
for

,
also
set
for
a

for

But
even
today
’s

may
be
part

the
market
’s
broader
volatility
.

This
may
not
be
a
longer
-

upward
trend
,
”
Lee
added
.

Gains
were
led
by
technology
issues
and
index
heavyweights
such
as
Samsung

,
which
was
up
2.3
percent
,
continuing
to
be
helped
by

estimates
announced

Sharp

help
,
as
Daewoo

advanced
4.5

“

have
become

said

it

The

flexed
their

comeback
victory
over
the
visiting
St.
Louis
Cardinals
on
Sunday
in
the
opener
of
the
National

.

The
Brewers
fought
back
from
a
5
-
2
deficit
with
a
six
-
run
,
fifth
-
inning
outburst
against
their
Central
Division
rivals
keyed
by
their
celebrated
sluggers
.

Ryan
Braun
and
Prince
Fielder
provided
the
knockout
blows
with
Braun
belting
a
two
-
run
double
and
Fielder
following
with
a
two
-
run
home
run
off
St

starter
and
loser
Jaime
Garcia
that
clanged
off
the
wall
beyond
the
bullpen
in

.

Shortstop
Yuniesky
Betancourt
added
another
two

run
homer
for
good
measure
off
reliever
Octavio
Dotel
as
Milwaukee
moved
from
a
three

run
deficit
into
a
three
-
run
lead
.

“
That
was
a
nice
inning
there
,
”
said
Milwaukee
manager
Ron
Roenicke
.

To
score
like
we
did
there
,
that
’s
outstanding
.

“
Brauny
,
you
know
,
big
double
there
,
drive
in
two
.

Followed
right
behind
it
with
the
Prince
homer
.

After
Fielder
crossed
the
plate
,
he
and
Braun
did
their
elaborate
version
of
some
fancy
shadow
boxing
.

That
’s
the
one
-
two
punch
,
”
explained
Braun
.

Game
Two
of
the

of

be

in

with

Edwin
Jackson
.

Zack
Greinke
,
a
spotless
11

0
during
the
regular
season
at
Miller
Park
,
gave
up
six
runs
in
six
-
plus
innings
of
work
in
Sunday
’s
game
but
registered
the
win
for
the
home
-
loving
Brewers
.

Milwaukee
,
which
had
the
best
home

record
in

at

,
won
at
home
for
the
fourth
time
without
a

so
far
this
postseason
.

While
the
Brewers
lapped
up
the
cheers
of
the
raucous
crowd
,
Cardinals
manager
Tony
La
Russa
was
left
to
ponder
what
went
wrong
for
25-year
-
old
left
-
hander
Garcia
.

“
I
thought
we
competed
on
the
offensive
side
great
all
night
.

I
wish
we
could
average
six
runs
a
game
for
the
rest
of
the
series
,
”
said
La
Russa
,
before
turning
his
thoughts
to
Garcia
.

“
It
was
a
weird
inning
,
because
he
was
really
good
,
and
then
just
three
pitches
,
bam
,
bam
,
bam
,
it
was
gone
,
”
he
said
.

Aware
that
there
was
no
love
lost
between
the
Central
champion
Brewers
and
wild
card
Cardinals
,
who
have
feuded
this
past
season
,
the
umpire
warned
both
benches
in
the
first

Fortunately

BEIJING
(

-
More
than
100
million
rural
Chinese
people
will
settle
in
towns
and
cities
in
the
next
decade
,
testing
provision
of
welfare
and
services
as
a
new
generation
of
migrants
turn
their
backs
on
farming
,
according
to
a
new
government
report
.

The
National
Population
and
Family
Planning
Commission
report
forecast
that
by
2020
,
China
’s
urban
population
would
pass
800
million
,
and
many
of
the
new
residents
are
rural
migrants
who
lack
old
-
age
and
medical
insurance
in
the
towns
and
cities
they
want
to
call
home
,
media
reports
said
on
Monday
.

The
study
,
based
on
survey
data
from
2010
,
is
the
latest
to
underscore
how
important
,
and
how
challenging
,
the
ramifications
of
China
’s
tide
of
urbanisation
are
.

Our
country
still
faces
many
challenges
in
achieving
healthy
urbanisation
,
”
said
the
report
,
according
to
a
summary
from
the
Xinhua
news
agency
.

At
present
,
we
still
have
not
formed
a
sensible
array
of
cities
and
towns
,
and
overall
urban
capacity
urgently
needs
to
be
strengthened
,
”
it
said
.

The
migrant
population
strongly
desires
to
be
absorbed
into
the
areas
where
they
live
,
but
there
is
a
stark
conflict
between
supply
and
demand
of
urban
public
services
.
”

China
’s
census
last
year
found
the
country
had
1.34
billion
people
,
and
670
million
were
residents
of
towns
and
cities
.

Many
new
urbanites
are
young
rural
migrants
with
no
plans
to
return
to
villages
and
farming
after
years
in
factories
and
on
building
sites
,
unlike
their
parents’
generation
.

Although
their
wages
have
risen
in
recent
years
,
this
“
new
generation
”
of
migrants
also
needs
better
housing
,
healthcare
and
schooling
opportunities
.

The
report
found
52
percent
of
Chinese
rural
migrants
had
no
social
welfare
insurance
.

In
June
,
migrant
workers
rioted
in
far
southern
China
’s
manufacturing
belt
,
trashing
government
offices
and
police
vehicles
after
a
pregnant
peddler
was
roughed
up
by
guards
,
triggering
anger
about
mistreatment
.

A
string
of
strikes
at
Japanese
-
owned
vehicle
parts
makers
last
year
also
showed
the
growing
assertiveness
of
younger
Chinese
workers
.

China
has
about
153
million
migrant
workers
living
outside
their
home
towns
,
and
by
2009
,
58.4
percent
of
them
were
“
new
generation
”
migrants
born
in
1980
or
after
,
according
to
an
earlier
National
Bureau
of
Statistics
survey
.

The
latest
report
found
that
76.3
percent
of
this
“
new
generation
”
of
migrants
had
no
plans
to
return
to
the
areas
they
came
from
,
and
most
of
those
that
did
have
plans
to
return
wanted
to
find
jobs
in
towns
,
not
return
to
farming
.

British
Prime
Minister
David
Cameron
has
called
for
“
safeguards
”
to
prevent
France
and
other
eurozone
countries
from
distorting
the
EU
’s
single
market
in
an
attempt
to
shift
financial
services
from
Britain
to
the
single
currency
area
,
the
Financial
Times
reported
on
Monday
.

Britain
already
intends
to
sue
the
ECB
for
setting
rules
that
allegedly
handicap
London
’s
finance
district
and
would
force
one
of
the
world
’s
largest
clearing
houses
to
decamp
operations
to
the
euro
area
.

“
There
is
an
argument
about
financial
services
and
how
we
best
regulate
and
make
them
safe
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
but
sometimes
these
things
seem
to
be
about
other
agendas
,
”
he
said
.

“
There
are
safeguards
that
will
need
to
be
put
in
place
which
may
not
require
a
treaty
change
.

Safeguards
for
countries
who
are
either
not
in
the
euro
or
do
n’t
want
to
join
the
euro
but
who
joined
a
Europe
that
was
predominantly
about
a
single
market

Salvage
experts
were
racing
to
secure
a
container
ship
which
ran
aground
on
a
reef
off
New
Zealand
as
oil
started
to
wash
up
on
Monday
along
beaches
of
a
popular
holiday
resort
.

The
47,230-tonne
Liberian
-
flagged
Rena
has
been
stuck
on
the
reef
,
about
12
nautical
miles
from
Tauranga
on
the
east
coast
of
the
country
’s
North
Island
,
since
running
aground
early
on
Wednesday
.

Maritime
New
Zealand
said
the
weather
was
about
to
get
worse
.

“
Seas
are
moderate
but
they
will
become
rough
later
,
there
will
be
poor
visibility

and
we
are
expecting
showers
,
”
it
said
in
a
statement
.

The
ship
is
carrying
1,700
tonnes
of
heavy
fuel
oil
,
which
has
been
transferred
to
secure
tanks
at
the
rear
of
the
vessel
and
is
slowly
being
pumped
into
a
barge
.

Containers
are
being
lashed
more
tightly
.

“
Salvage
experts
and
naval
architects
on
board
are
very
closely
monitoring
the
ship
and
have
got
sensors
in
place
that
will
provide
advance
warning
if
the
vessel
’s
structure
is
coming
under
too
much
stress
,
”
Maritime
NZ
said
.

The
first
oil
from
the
ship
has
also
been
found
on
nearby
beaches
with
clean
up
teams
moving
in
to
collect
the
fist
-
sized
clumps
of
thick
,
toxic
oil
.

The
district
is
a
popular
holiday
resort
,
with
long
,
golden
beaches
renowned
for
surfing
,
and
nearby
waters
with
an
international
reputation
for
big
-
game
fishing
.

As
much
as
30
tonnes
of
oil
is
estimated
to
have
escaped
from
the
236-metre
ship
,
which
has
been
holed
in
two
forward
compartments
and
is
listing
at
10
degrees
.

All
vents
have
been
sealed
to
prevent
oil
escaping
.

Several
seabirds
have
died
and
about
a
dozen
have
been
recovered
and
treated
for
oil
contamination
.

The
ship
’s
owners
,
Daina
Shipping
,
a
unit
of
Greece
’s
Costamare
Inc.
,
said
minimising
the
pollution
risk
was
the
priority
.

“
The
current
primary
focus
of
the
salvage
operations
is
the
safe
transfer
of
the
vessel
’s
fuel
oil
from
her
tanks
into
a
suitable
vessel
,
”
Costamare
said
.

Refloating
and
salvage
of
the
ship
,
of
which
more
than
half
is
aground
on
the
reef
,
is
the
responsibility
of
the
owners
and
salvage
experts
,
but
any
plan
needs
official
approval
.

Although

was

,
the

was

I

An

as
the
National
Hockey
League
(

to

The

beat
the
Jets
5
-
1
in
Winnipeg
’s

game
of

but
the
result
was
hardly
the

the
Manitoba
provincial
capital
reclaimed
what
it
once
lost
to

economics

True

Salvage
experts
were
racing
to
secure
a
container
ship
which
ran
aground
on
a
reef
off
New
Zealand
as
oil
started
to
wash
up
on
Monday
along
beaches
of
a
popular
holiday
resort
.

The
47,230-tonne
Liberian
-
flagged
Rena
has
been
stuck
on
the
reef
,
about
12
nautical
miles
from
Tauranga
on
the
east
coast
of
the
country
’s
North
Island
,
since
running
aground
early
on
Wednesday
.

Maritime
New
Zealand
said
the
weather
was
about
to
get
worse
.

“
Seas
are
moderate
but
they
will
become
rough
later
,
there
will
be
poor
visibility

and
we
are
expecting
showers
,
”
it
said
in
a
statement
.

The
ship
is
carrying
1,700
tonnes
of
heavy
fuel
oil
,
which
has
been
transferred
to
secure
tanks
at
the
rear
of
the
vessel
and
is
slowly
being
pumped
into
a
barge
.

Containers
are
being
lashed
more
tightly
.

“
Salvage
experts
and
naval
architects
on
board
are
very
closely
monitoring
the
ship
and
have
got
sensors
in
place
that
will
provide
advance
warning
if
the
vessel
’s
structure
is
coming
under
too
much
stress
,
”
Maritime
NZ
said
.

The
first
oil
from
the
ship
has
also
been
found
on
nearby
beaches
with
clean
up
teams
moving
in
to
collect
the
fist
-
sized
clumps
of
thick
,
toxic
oil
.

The
district
is
a
popular
holiday
resort
,
with
long
,
golden
beaches
renowned
for
surfing
,
and
nearby
waters
with
an
international
reputation
for
big
-
game
fishing
.

As
much
as
30
tonnes
of
oil
is
estimated
to
have
escaped
from
the
236-meter
ship
,
which
has
been
holed
in
two
forward
compartments
and
is
listing
at
10
degrees
.

All
vents
have
been
sealed
to
prevent
oil
escaping
.

Several
seabirds
have
died
and
about
a
dozen
have
been
recovered
and
treated
for
oil
contamination
.

The
ship
’s
owners
,
Daina
Shipping
,
a
unit
of
Greece
’s
Costamare
Inc.
,
said
minimising
the
pollution
risk
was
the
priority
.

“
The
current
primary
focus
of
the
salvage
operations
is
the
safe
transfer
of
the
vessel
’s
fuel
oil
from
her
tanks
into
a
suitable
vessel
,
”
Costamare
said
.

Refloating
and
salvage
of
the
ship
,
of
which
more
than
half
is
aground
on
the
reef
,
is
the
responsibility
of
the
owners
and
salvage
experts
,
but
any
plan
needs
official
approval
.

Global
miner
BHP
Billiton
moved
a
step
closer
on
Monday
toward
an
estimated
$
20
billion
expansion
of
its
massive
Olympic
Dam
copper
and
uranium
mine
,
securing
federal
environmental
approval
for
the
project
in
the
deserts
of
south
Australia
.

BHP
Billiton
is
expected
to
give
the
final
go
-
ahead
to
the
project
by
June
2012
.

It
has
yet
to
reveal
the
cost
of
the
expansion
,
but
analysts
rank
it
as
possibly
the
single
biggest
on
the
drawing
board
of
the
world
’s
biggest
miner
.

The
federal
government
imposed
more
than
100
conditions
on
the
expansion
.

“
The
strict
conditions
I
’ve
imposed
will
help
ensure
protection
of
the
natural
environment
,
including
native
species
,
groundwater
and
vegetation
,
for
the
long
term
,
”
Environment
Minister
Tony
Burke
said
in
a
statement
.

The
expansion
still
needs
approvals
from
the
South
Australian
and
Northern
Territory
governments
,
expected
to
follow
soon
.

Monday
’s
clearance
follows
a
six
-
year
review
of
the
expected
impact
of
the
expansion
on
everything
from
air
quality
in
neighbouring
towns
to
cuttlefish
in
the
Spencer
Gulf
.

The
expansion
calls
for
a
new
open
-
pit
mine
to
increase
production
capacity
to
a
maximum
of
750,000
tonnes
a
year
of
copper
,
or
nearly
quadruple
its
current
production
.

The
expansion
would
lift
the
mine
’s
annual
production
of
uranium
to
19,000
tonnes
,
from
around
4,000
tonnes
now
.

The
plan
includes
building
a
new
airport
,
a
new
gas
-
fired
power
station
,
a
desalination
plant
with
a
320-kilometre
pipeline
and
a
105-km
rail
line
.

BHP
has
not
given
any
cost
estimate
for
the
expansion
except
to
say
that
Olympic
Dam
would
make
up
a
“
modest
proportion
”
of
the
company
’s
plan
to
spend
$
80
billion
on
projects
over
the
next
five
years
.

Oct

(

-
Australia
’s
competition
watchdog
said
on
Monday
it
would
pay
close
attention
to
the
market
power
of
top
supermarkets
Woolworths
and
Coles
,
which
hold
a
duopoly
.

The
Australian
Competition
and
Consumer
Commission
’s
new
chairman
,
Rod
Sims
,
said
many
suppliers
felt
they
had
no
ability
to
negotiate
with
the
powerful
supermarket
chains
.

The
two
major
supermarkets
have
significant
market
power
,
with
many
smaller
suppliers
feeling
they
lack
a
real
ability
to
negotiate
supply
arrangements
.

The
ACCC
can
and
will
watch
closely
to
ensure
any
such
dealings
do
not
involve
unconscionable
conduct
by
the
supermarkets
,
”
Sims
told
a
business
lunch
.

Many
local
and
international
food
suppliers
,
including
Kraft
Foods
and
Goodman
Fielder
,
have
said
they
have
little
ability
to
negotiate
as
the
two
supermarket
chains
dominate
the
industry
and
have
also
increased
their
share
of
home
-
label
goods
.

Sims
said
the
supermarkets
would
need
close
scrutiny
to
ensure
they
did
not
misuse
market
power
by
selling
both
branded
and
private
-
label
products
.

In
2008
,
the
consumer
watchdog
held
an
inquiry
into
the
supermarket
industry
and
concluded
it
was
“
workably
competitive
”
.

Sims
said
the
ACCC
would
also
watch
dominant
telecoms
firm
Telstra
during
the
rollout
phase
of
the
new
high
-
speed
broadband
network
,
when
rivals
will
still
depend
on
Telstra
’s
copper
network
.

For
only
the
second
time
in
348
career
starts
on
the
PGA
Tour
,
Briny
Baird
felt
he
was
poised
to
win
a
tournament
before
falling
agonisingly
short
Sunday
at
the
Frys.com
Open
.

Seeking
his
maiden
victory
on
the
U.S.
circuit
,
journeyman
Baird
was
beaten
by
fellow
American
Bryce
Molder
on
the
sixth
hole
of
a
sudden
-
death
playoff
after
missing
a
seven
-
foot
birdie
putt
for
the
title
four
holes
earlier
.

“
I
’m
happy
,
and
I
’m
very
disappointed
,
”
Baird
told
reporters
after
watching
Molder
sink
a
six
-
footer
for
birdie
at
the
par
-
four
18th
to
claim
his
own
breakthrough
success
on
the
PGA
Tour
.

“
I
know
how
long
I
’ve
played
,
and
I
lost
my
concentration
one
time
today
and
it
was
one
of
the
putts
that
I
had
to
win
the
golf
tournament
.

I
looked
ahead
,
and
that
was
a
mistake
,
”
he
said
,
referring
to
a
missed
birdie
opportunity
on
the
second
extra
hole
.

“
I
do
n’t
know
if
I
missed
the
putt
because
of
that
or
what
,
but
I
did
some
really
good
things
today
.

I
was
happy
with
the
good
things
,
I
’m
not
happy
with
the
outcome
,
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
?

Baird
,
who
had
led
by
two
shots
going
into
the
final
round
at
CordeValle
Golf
Club
,
closed
with
a
four
-
under
-
par
67
to
finish
level
with
Molder
at
17-under
267
.

Four
times
previously
Baird
had
been
a
runner
-
up
on
the
PGA
Tour
but
only
once
-
at
the
2001
John
Deere
Classic
-
did
he
feel
capable
of
clinching
the
title
.

I
did
n’t
feel
like
I
was
out
there
to
win
the
tournament
,
”
Baird
,
39
,
said
.

I
was
ready
for
the
tournament
to
kind
of
fall
back
to
me
.

Today
I
felt
like
I
was
out
there
to
win
the
tournament
.

I
hit
some
shots
when
I
really
needed
to
hit
some
shots
,
and
for
me
that
’s
a
big
deal
.

There
’s
a
hurdle
that
I
overcame
today
.

Baird
appeared
to
have
the
title
in
his
grasp
in
regulation
play
after
he
chipped
in
to
eagle
the
drivable
par
-
four
17th
but
Molder
joined
him
at
17
under
with
a
birdie
at
the
last
.

“
Going
into
the
day
,
it
was
like
a
lot
of
Sundays
I
’ve
gone
into
,
”
Baird
said
.

I
was
n’t
feeling
great
,
but
I
figured
if
I
could
just
stick
to
my
game
plan
and
stick
with
a
routine
...

And
I
did
that
really
,
really
good
.

The
Detroit
Tigers
have
lost
Magglio
Ordonez
for
the
remainder
of
the
playoffs
after
the
veteran
outfielder
re
-
injured
his
troublesome
right
ankle
,
the
team
said
on
Sunday
.

Ordonez
was
taken
out
of
the
Tigers’
series
-
opening
loss
to
the
Texas
Rangers
in
the
fifth
inning
on
Saturday
,
and
it
was
later
revealed
that
the
37-year
-
old
had
broken
the
same
ankle
that
forced
him
to
miss
the
second
half
of
the
2010
season
.

We
did
n’t
have
all
the
facts
and
details
,
but
we
’ve
had
some
medical
work
done
this
morning
,
”
Tigers
manager
Jim
Leyland
told
the
team
’s
website
(
Detroit.tigers.mlb.com
)
.

The
Tigers
,
who
trail
1
-
0
in
their
best
-
of
-
seven
American
League
Championship
Series
against
the
Rangers
,
are
already
short
on
outfielders
.

Delmon
Young
was
also
kept
off
the
ALCS
roster
because
of
an
oblique
strain
suffered
in
the
Tigers’
Game
Five
victory
over
the
New
York
Yankees
in
their
AL
Division
Series
.

Ordonez
has
played
with
the
Tigers
since
2005
and
was
hitting
.385
during
the
playoffs
.

Game
Two
of
the
series
was
postponed
on
Sunday
because
of
rain
in
Texas
and
has
been
rescheduled
for
Monday
.

SINGAPORE
,
October
9
(
Fitch
)
Fitch
Ratings
says
the
ongoing
capitalisation
efforts
of
major
Vietnamese
banks
are
positive
given
their
thinly
capitalised
position
by
regional
comparison
.

Given
the
challenging
operating
environment
,
capitalisation
levels
are
a
key
credit
factor
and
Fitch
believes
more
equity
may
still
be
required
.

Although
credit
growth
has
moderated
in
2011
and
notwithstanding
fresh
capital
injection
,
higher
capitalisation
buffer
is
crucial
for
potential
losses
as
well
as
for
future
expansion
plans
,
”
says
Mikho
Irawady
in
Fitch
’s
Financial
Institutions
team
.

“
Banks
in
general
continue
to
target
rapid
growth
in
a
country
where
credit
reached
120
%
of
GDP
at
end-2010
,
high
by
emerging
market
standards
.

This
exposes
the
banks
to
sharp
deterioration
in
asset
quality
should
the
already
difficult
operating
environment
take
a
turn
for
the
worse
.
”

In
addition
,
Fitch
believes
that
the
system
-
wide
gross
non
-
performing
loan
ratio
may
be
significantly
higher
than
the
reported
3
%
at
end
-
July
2011
,
noting
the
differences
in
asset
quality
data
between
Vietnamese
Accounting
Standards
and
International
Financial
Reporting
Standards
and
poor
transparency
.

Fitch
recognises
the
regulatory
efforts
to
raise
capital
levels
,
although
these
have
been
subjected
to
delays
in
the
past
.

The
agency
believes
regulatory
capital
requirements
may
be
raised
further
and
could
eventually
lead
to
consolidation
in
the
system
over
the
medium
to
long
term
,
especially
for
the
smaller
banks
in
Vietnam
.

Increased
foreign
banks’
participation
may
be
positive
,
by
way
of
strengthening
technical
assistance
,
knowledge
transfer
and
risk
management
,
although
any
liberalisation
moves
are
more
likely
to
be
a
long
-
term
prospect
.

In
the
near
term
,
committed
efforts
by
the
government
to
bring
more
stability
to
the
operating
environment
,
such
as
reducing
inflation
,
are
crucial
to
the
banks’
financial
profiles
.

At
least
11
Chinese
sailors
were
killed
when
their
ships
were
attacked
on
the
Mekong
River
between
Thailand
and
Myanmar
,
the
Chinese
Foreign
Ministry
said
,
voicing
concern
about
what
media
reports
said
was
an
assault
by
drug
traffickers
.

The
sailors
were
on
two
cargo
ships
attacked
on
October
5
in
the
“
Golden
Triangle
”
of
the
Mekong
,
a
region
of
Southeast
Asia
notorious
for
its
illicit
drug
trade
,
the
Chinese
Foreign
Ministry
said
on
its
website
(
www.mfa.gov.cn
)
late
Sunday
.

As
well
as
the
11
sailors
killed
,
two
were
missing
,
said
the
ministry
.

But
officials
in
Yunnan
,
the
Chinese
province
bordering
Thailand
and
Myanmar
,
said
12
were
killed
and
one
was
missing
,
the
China
News
Service
said
.

The
bodies
were
recovered
near
Chiang
Saen
,
a
river
port
in
north
Thailand
,
with
hands
bound
and
eyes
covered
with
adhesive
tape
,
the
China
Daily
reported
.

China
’s
growing
presence
in
Asia
,
Africa
and
other
parts
of
the
world
has
prompted
attacks
,
kidnappings
and
hijackings
,
and
the
issue
has
become
a
sensitive
one
for
Chinese
officials
,
who
do
not
want
to
appear
weak
in
protecting
nationals
.

Beijing
has
“
asked
the
countries
concerned
to
take
effective
measures
to
strengthen
protection
of
Chinese
vessels
and
crew
on
the
Mekong
River
,
”
the
Foreign
Ministry
said
.

Crew
on
another
boat
that
saw
the
attack
said
eight
or
so
armed
men
stormed
the
two
ships
,
said
the
China
News
Service
.

The
attackers
appeared
to
be
smugglers
seeking
to
use
the
seized
ships
to
traffic
drugs
,
said
the
report
,
citing
Thai
media
accounts
.

The
owner
of
one
of
the
boats
attacked
said
robberies
were
common
on
the
river
,
said
the
China
Daily
.

Thai
river
police
recovered
the
two
boats
after
a
gunfight
with
the
men
onboard
and
found
five
sacks
holding
a
total
of
about
900,000
pills
of
methamphetamine
,
or
“
speed
,
”
an
illegal
drug
,
said
the
China
Daily
,
citing
Thai
news
reports
.

The
Mekong
snakes
from
China
into
Southeast
Asia
,
where
it
forms
part
of
Thailand
’s
border
with
Myanmar
and
Laos
,
and
in
2001
the
four
countries
signed
an
agreement
to
regularize
shipping
on
the
river
.

The
4,900-km
(

Global
miner
BHP
Billiton

secured
environmental
approval
from
the
South
Australian
government
on
Monday
for
an
estimated
$
20
billion
expansion
of
its
massive
Olympic
Dam
copper
and
uranium
mine
.

BHP
Billiton
is
expected
to
give
the
final
go
-
ahead
for
the
project
by
June
2012
.

It
has
yet
to
reveal
the
cost
of
the
expansion
but
analysts
rank
it
as
possibly
the
single
biggest
on
the
drawing
board
of
the
world
’s
biggest
miner
.

The
state
approval
comes
only
hours
after
the
federal
government
also
gave
the
project
the
environmental
go
-
ahead
.

The
South
Australia
state
government
,
in
announcing
the

’s
key
approval
,
made
it
a

that
the
company

Tom

the

’s

said
in
a
statement
.

Winless
on
the
PGA
Tour
this
season
,
three
-
times
major
champion
Ernie
Els
was
once
again
left
to
rue
erratic
putting
after
he
tied
for
fourth
at
the
Frys.com
Open
Sunday
.

The
smooth
-
swinging
South
African
,
who
used
a
belly
putter
at
CordeValle
Golf
Club
this
week
after
mainly
struggling
on
the
greens
in
recent
years
,
briefly
held
a
share
of
the
lead
early
in
Sunday
’s
final
round
before
slipping
back
.

“
I
’m
a
little
disappointed
because
I
feel
I
played
good
enough
to
maybe
be
in
the
playoff
,
”
Els
told
reporters
after
totaling
29
putts
and
posting
a
14-under
total
of
270
,
three
shy
of
going
into
extra
holes
for
the
title
.

”
he
said
of
his
six
-
foot
attempt
for
birdie
which
horseshoed
out
of
the
cup
.

I
lipped
out
and
then
I
missed
another
short
one
on
10
.

“
I
made
a
lot
of
good
putts
throughout
the
week
,
but
I
just
feel
if
I
want
to
get
to
that
next
level

I
want
to
get
to
,
I
got
ta
start
making
those
putts
when
I
need
them
.

I
did
that
when
I
won
,
so
I
know
what
to
do
.
”

An
18-times
winner
on
the
PGA
Tour
,
Els
has
not
triumphed
on
the
U.S.
circuit
since
the
2010
Arnold
Palmer
Invitational
and
he
had
struggled
this
season
with
a
best
finish
of
joint
15th
in
his
previous
20
starts
.

“
I
have
changed
a
lot
of
things
and
I
feel
that
the
work
I
’ve
put
in
is
starting
to
come
through
,
”
said
Els
,
who
has
reunited
with
his
long
-
time
caddie
Ricci
Roberts
and
also
changed
management
companies
.

“
I
’m
starting
to
feel
comfortable
on
the
things
I
’ve
been
working
on
.

This
week
,
I
think
we
’ve
made
some
progress
,
even
though
we
’ve
came
up
short
.

The
wheels
are
starting
to
turn
now
.

Els
,
who
decided
to
compete
in
this
week
’s
second
-
tier
Fall
Series
event
in
a
bid
to
regain
to
form
and
also
to
help
out
one
of
his
corporate
sponsors
,
only
gave
up
on
his
title
bid
after
the
penultimate
hole
.

Even
on
17
,
I
thought
I
still
had
a
chance
,
but
then
Briny
(
Baird
)
chipped
it
in
for
eagle
,
and
that
was
that
,
”
the
41-year
-
old
South
African
,
popularly
known
as
the
‘
Big
Easy’
,
said
after
closing
with
a
three
-
under
68
.

“
I
thought
maybe
if
I
could
sneak
an
eagle
there
and
then
birdie
the
18th
,
I
could
get
into
a
playoff
.

You
kind
of
never
give
up
until
the
end
,
but
when
he
made
eagle
,
it
was
done
.
”

Baird
ended
up
losing
the
playoff
to
fellow
American
Bryce
Molder
on
the
sixth
extra
hole
.

Bryce
Molder
won
his
first
PGA
Tour
title
by
outlasting
fellow
American
Briny
Baird
in
a
nerve
-
jangling
playoff
for
the
Frys.com
Open
at
CordeValle
Golf
Club
on
Sunday
.

Molder
sealed
victory
with
a
six
-
foot
birdie
putt
at
the
par
-
four
18th
,
the
sixth
extra
hole
,
where
Baird
could
only
par
after
his
drive
ended
up
in
thick
rough
to
the
right
of
the
fairway
.

As
his
ball
disappeared
into
the
cup
,
Molder
dropped
his
putter
to
the
ground
in
a
mixture
of
delight
and
relief
before
embracing
his
caddie
and
shaking
hands
with
Baird
.

“
It
’s
a
little
surreal
right
now
,
”
the
32-year
-
old
American
said
greenside
in
fading
light
after
finally
breaking
into
the
winner
’s
circle
on
his
132nd
PGA
Tour
start
.

A
lot
of
golf
today
,
but
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
.

“
You
practice
and
you
work
and
everything
,
and
you
just
hope
there
is
some
validation
behind
it
.

I
got
some
breaks
at
the
right
time
today
and
I
am
excited
.
”

Journeyman
Baird
,
who
had
been
seeking
his
maiden
PGA
Tour
victory
on
his
348th
start
after
career
earnings
of
nearly
$
12
million
,
settled
for
a
fifth
runner
-
up
finish
on
the
circuit
.

“
I
played
really
well
,
”
the
39-year
-
old
American
said
.

Obviously
I
am
very
disappointed
right
now
.

but
I
honestly
thought
I
’d
be
standing
right
where
Bryce
is
.

Support
for
Japanese
Prime
Minister
Yoshihiko
Noda
’s
government
dropped
by
10
points
to
55
percent
one
month
after
he
took
office
,
with
more
than
half
opposing
planned
tax
increases
for
post
-
quake
restructuring
efforts
,
a
poll
showed
on
Monday
.

Noda
,
who
became
the
country
’s
sixth
prime
minister
in
five
years
,
had
gained
strong
support
shortly
after
taking
office
in
early
September
—
a
sharp
turnaround
from
his
unpopular
predecessor
,
Naoto
Kan
,
who
saw
his
support
fall
below
20
percent
.

But
just
after
a
week
in
office
,
Noda
was
forced
to
fire
his
trade
minister
due
to
gaffes
.

The
disapproval
rating
for
his
government
rose
to
29
percent
,
the
survey
by
Yomiuri
newspaper
showed
,
up
10
points
from
the
previous
month
’s
poll
.

Noda
,
a
fiscal
hawk
who
favors
raising
taxes
to
increase
government
revenue
,
has
promised
swift
fiscal
reforms
to
cope
with
the
massive
public
debt
—
now
twice
the
size
of
Japan
’s
$
5
trillion
economy
—
but
with
an
eye
on
growth
.

The
survey
of
1,036
respondents
showed
that
55
percent
were
against
the
government
’s
plan
to
raise
income
and
corporate
taxes
to
support
the
restructuring
of
northeastern
Japan
hit
hard
by
the
devastating
March
11
earthquake
and
tsunami
.

It
showed
38
backed
the
tax
hike
plans
.

The
March
disaster
triggered
the
world
’s
worst
nuclear
crisis
since
Chernobyl
in
1986
,
heating
up
debate
in
Japan
over
its
future
energy
policy
.

The
survey
showed
48
percent
supported
Noda
’s
plan
to
restart
nuclear
power
plants
that
have
completed
routine
inspections
,
while
38
percent
opposed
the
idea
.

Japan
’s
is
aiming
to
launch
this
month
its
public
-
private
panel
chaired
by
Noda
for
devising
long
-
term
policies
spanning
economic
,
trade
and
energy
that
it
hopes
will
wield
considerable
clout
in
running
the
country
.

The
panel
is
expected
to
discuss
whether
to
join
negotiations
on
a
U.S
.-
led
free
trade
pact
,
called
the
Transpacific
Partnership
(
TPP
)
.

The
Yomiuri
poll
showed
51
percent
said
Japan
should
join
the
TPP
talks
,
while
23
percent
were
against
the
idea
.

Many
Japanese
businesses
are
keen
to
join
the
TPP
,
which
could
add
growth
,
though
farming
lobbies
have
resisted
the
move
as
it
would
lower
barriers
to
goods
and
services
from
overseas
.

Noda
said
on
Monday
the
government
would
make
a
decision
on
whether
to
join
the
TPP
talks
in
the
near
term
after
launching
formal
discussions
on
the
issue

SINGAPORE

SYDNEY
,
Oct

(
Reuters
)
-

The
euro
edged
higher
on
Monday
after
leaders
of
Germany
and
France
promised
a
new
comprehensive
plan
to
recapitalise
euro
zone
banks
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
though
markets
remain
wary
as
they
have
been
disappointed
many
times
before
.

The
meeting
between
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
and
French
President
Nicolas
Sarkozy
offered
no
details
,
but
drew
a
pledge
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
shore
up
banks
,
settle
the
Greek
crisis
and
help
growth
in
Europe
,
giving
a
gentle
boost
to
risk
sentiment
.
.

Market
players
,
however
,
remained
cautious
given
the
lack
of
details
and
since
EU
leaders
have
promised
several
times
before
to
resolve
the
debt
crisis
,
to
no
avail
.

The
positive
response
could
simply
reflect
the
fact
that
positioning
is
now
more
balanced
following
earlier
risk
reduction
,

at
Citi
in
Singapore
,
said
in
a
research
note
.

It
looks
unlikely
that
EUR
gains
can
be
sustained
absent
further
positive
developments
,
”
he
added
.

The
euro
climbed
0.5
percent
to
$
1.3451
,
pulling
away
from
a
nine
-
month
low
of
$
1.3145
hit
last
week
on
trading
platform
EBS
.

The
single
currency
’s
rise
gained
added
steam
after
it
breached
hourly
resistance
at
$
1.3423
.

Concrete
steps
to
recapitalise
euro
zone
banks
could
offer
some
relief
to
the
euro
,
which
has
been
dogged
by
mounting
worries
about
the
impact
of
the
euro
zone
’s
debt
crisis
on
the
European
banking
sector
.

France
,
Belgium
and
Luxembourg
agreed
a
rescue
plan
for
Dexia
,
while
other
French
banks
have
come
under
intense
pressure
because
of
their
exposure
to
Greece
and
other
weak
European
countries
.

BNP
Paribas
and
Societe
Generale
denied
they
would
seek
to
raise
a
combined
11
billion
euros
as
part
of
a
broader
European
recapitalisation
plan
.

The
single
currency
faces
short
-
term
resistance
at
around
$
1.3483
,
the
76.4
percent
retracement
of
the
euro
’s
drop
from
Friday
’s
peak
of
$
1.3525
down
to
a
low
of
$
1.3346
hit
during
early
Asian
trade
on
Monday
.

“
On
the
open
Sydney
ran
the
sell
stops
down
through
Friday
’s
lows
in
EUR
/
USD
...

So
now
that
those
orders
are
done
,
path
of
least
resistance
is
up

The
pledge
from
Merkel
and
Sarkozy
to
come
up
with
fresh
measures
to
solve
the
euro
zone
’s
debt
crisis
lent
support
to
equities
and
helped
nudge
the
Australian
dollar
higher
.

The
Aussie
dollar
rose
0.5
percent
to
$
0.9813
,
pulling
further
away
from
a
one
-
year
low
of
$
0.9388
hit
last
week
.

One
risk
for
the
euro
and
risky
assets
in
general
is
the
fact
that
the
next
aid
tranche
for
Greece
is
far
from
being
a
done
deal
with
the
IMF
indicating
the
nation
is
at
a
crossroads
and
will
need
to
implement
“
much
stricter
structural
reforms
”
than
seen
so
far
.

Athens
could
run
out
of
cash
as
soon
as
mid
-
November
without
the
new
8
billion
euro
aid
installment
,
increasing
the
risk
of
a
default
that
would
drag
the
region
deeper
into
a
debt
crisis
already
shaking
financial
markets
worldwide
.

Trading
is
expected
to
be
thin
throughout
Monday
with
Japan
off
while
the
U.S.
celebrates
Columbus
Day
.
