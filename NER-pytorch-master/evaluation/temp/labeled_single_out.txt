beautifully O

that O

much O
less O

It O
's O
certainly O
and O
surely O
possible O
. O
Would O

have O
been O

How O
defined O
was O
the O
character O
of O
Gus S-PER
when O
you O
signed O

show O
? O
Was O
it O
written O
on O
the O
page O
that O
you O
would O
play O
him O

this O
deliberate O
man O
, O
or O
did O
you O
make O
all O
these O
choices O
about O
how O
to O
portray O
him O
? O
I O
hate O
to O
take O
all O
of O
the O
credit O
for O
what O
I O
do O
, O
because O
the O

is O
so O
stellar O
and O
I O
pay O
such O
close O

everything O

Questions O
Answered O
in O
the O
Season B-ORG
Premiere E-ORG
How O
did O
the O
character O
become O
integral O
to O
the O
story O
? O
What O
happened O
was O
that O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
that O
guest O
spot O
. O
Within O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
of O
me O
finishing O
the O
first O
one O
, O
they O
said O
, O
' O
Would O
you O
come O
back O
and O
do O
the O
season O
ender O
? O
' O
Then O
they O
came O
back O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Would O
you O
do O
more O
? O
' O
I O
said O
yeah O
, O
I O
would O
, O
but O
not O
as O
a O
guest O
star O
. O
They O
asked O
me O
to O
do O
seven O
more O
guest O
spots O
, O
and O
I O
said O
, O
' O
No O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
interested O
in O
that O
. O
I O
'm O
interested O
in O
really O
finding O
out O
who O
this O
character O
is O
. O
' O
I O
prefaced O
all O
of O
that O
by O
saying O
that O
I O
loved O
the O
show O
. O
I O
adore O
and O
think O
that O
Vince B-PER
Gilligan E-PER
is O
brilliant O
. O
But O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
just O
come O
in O
and O
out O
… O
I O
want O
to O
come O
in O
and O
have O
a O
full O
canvas O
to O
work O
with O
, O
and O
I O
expressed O
that O
. O
I O
wound O
up O
doing O
11 O
, O
which O
was O
a O
clear O
indication O
… O
of O
their O
trust O
and O
devotion O
to O
doing O
what O
I O
previously O
had O
asked O
for O
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
able O
to O
create O
a O
complete O
character O
and O
to O
be O
part O
of O
a O
family O
. O
But O
again O
, O
Gus S-PER
was O
just O
a O
nice O
guy O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
chicken O
joint O
, O
who O
probably O
had O
some O
secrets O
, O
and O
they O
were O
hoping O
to O
uncover O
some O
of O
that O
. O
I O
am O
in O
gratitude O
that O
they O
found O
, O
through O
my O
performance O
, O
that O
they O
would O
like O
to O
uncover O
a O
whole O
lot O
more O
. O
Which O
they O
definitely O
did O
, O
especially O
, O
as O
we O
discussed O
, O
in O
the O
" O
Hermanos S-PER
" O
episode O
. O
It O
was O
so O
satisfying O
for O
viewers O
to O
get O
a O
glimpse O
at O
what O
motivates O
Gus S-ORG
… O
did O
you O
feel O
that O
way O
, O
too O
, O
when O
you O
read O
the O
script O
? O
I O
've O
done O
other O
shows O
and O
other O
series O
, O
and O
they O
go O
along O
, O
and O
you O
have O
a O
dual O
thing O
going O
on O
, O
where O
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
be O
on O
something O
that O
's O
quality O
, O
and O
to O
make O
some O
money O
and O
feed O
your O
family O
. O
Then O
, O
once O
( O
your O
character O
) O
gets O
your O
office O
or O
your O
home O
, O
you O
know O
you O
're O
going O
to O
be O
around O
for O
a O
while O
. O
You O
're O
like O
, O
' O
Yay S-PER
, O
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
write O
me O
out O
. O
With O
this O
( O
episode O
) O
, O
the O
triumph O
was O
that O
they O
asked O
me O
for O
some O
family O
pictures O
. O
I O
brought O
in O
pictures O
of O
my O
four O
daughters O
and O
put O
them O
all O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
( O
Viewers S-MISC
) O
never O
really O
saw O
them O
, O
but O
just O
in O
case O
one O
day O
they O
did O
and O
wanted O
to O
reflect O
back O
to O
that O
scene O
, O
they O
could O
see O
my O
family O
, O
which O
meant O
( O
Gus S-PER
) O
could O
have O
a O
wife O
. O
other O
… O
I O
could O
be O
living O
like O
Gus S-PER
does O
in O
plain O
sight O
, O
but O
have O
the O
trimmings O
of O
the O
whole O
family O
. O
But O
, O
yes O
, O
for O
people O
to O
see O
the O
background O
of O
a O
character O
that O
you O
create O
and O
understand O
… O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
our O
villains O
that O
we O
experience O
, O
in O
many O
ways O
they O
're O
one O
note O
. O
I O
certainly O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
Gus S-PER
be O
that O

What O
truly O
motivates O
Gus S-PER
, O
especially O
going O
forward O
, O
now O
that O
he O
's O
got O
his O
revenge O
on O
Don B-PER
Eladio E-PER

Tio S-LOC
? O
I O
think O
that O
what O
motivates O
Gus S-PER
for O
much O
of O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
has O
been O
revenge O
, O
building O
his O
empire O
, O
playing O
his O
cards O
right O
. O
But O
since O
that O
really O
horrible O
moment O
that O
we O
finally O
see O
in O
( O
" O
Hermanos S-PER
" O
) O
, O
we O
understand O
him O
a O
different O
way O
. O
It O
's O
not O
only O
revenge O
, O
but O
the O
revenge O
has O
played O
into O
taking O
over O
, O
into O
making O
this O
family O
his O
family O
. O
I O
think O
if O
we O
were O
to O
go O
back O
even O
further O
than O
that O
, O
we O
'd O
see O
his O
connection O
to O
the O
Pinochet O
government O
and O
where O
all O
the O
previous O
incarnations O
of O
Gus S-PER
came O
from O
and O
what O
his O
dream O
for O
his O
empire S-MISC
is O
. O
We O
have O
n't O
seen O
that O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
motivation O
is O
a O
two O
- O
fold O
motivation O
. O
It O
's O
to O
bring O
people O
to O
their O
best O

puts O
it O
in O
this O

and O
kills O
Gus S-PER

Gus S-PER
stands O
down O

and O
you O
're O
like O

up O
all O
these O
different O
little O
aspects O
of O
this O
piece O

think O
a O

acknowledges O
that O
there O

a O
beginning O

middle O
and O
end O

I O
think O
it O

going O

be O
a O
discovery O
for O
him O
, O
as O
it O
will O
be O
for O
us O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
want O

right O
now O

I O
just O
want O

But O
Dexia S-PER

key O
problem O
was O
a O

Its O
business O

Critics O
say O
the O
Dexia S-PER

become O
the O

engine O

resurgent O
Dexia S-ORG
in O

Some O
say O
an O
authoritarian O

the O
departure O

the O

Concerning S-ORG
the O
management O

I O
would O
like O
to O
note O

what O
happened O

Dexia S-PER

an O

the O

Concerning S-ORG
the O
management O

I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
that O
what O
happened O
