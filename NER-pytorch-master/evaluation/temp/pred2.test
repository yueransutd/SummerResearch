The O
European O
Commission O
said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
disagreed O
with O
German O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
shun O
British O
lamb O
until O
scientists O
determine O
whether O
mad O
cow O
disease O
can O
be O
transmitted O
to O
sheep O
. O

Germany O
's O
representative O
to O
the O
European O
Union O
's O
veterinary O
committee O
Werner O
Zwingmann O
said O
on O
Wednesday O
consumers O
should O
buy O
sheepmeat O
from O
countries O
other O
than O
Britain O
until O
the O
scientific O
advice O
was O
clearer O
. O

" O
We O
do O
n't O
support O
any O
such O
recommendation O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
see O
any O
grounds O
for O
it O
, O
" O
the O
Commission O
's O
chief O
spokesman O
Nikolaus O
van O
der O
Pas O
told O
a O
news O
briefing O
. O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O
study O
was O
required O
and O
if O
it O
was O
found O
that O
action O
was O
needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European O
Union O
. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O
month O
by O
EU O
Farm O
Commissioner O
Franz O
Fischler O
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O
cords O
from O
the O
human O
and O
animal O
food O
chains O
was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler O
proposed O
EU-wide O
measures O
after O
reports O
from O
Britain O
and O
France O
that O
under O
laboratory O
conditions O
sheep O
could O
contract O
Bovine O
Spongiform O
Encephalopathy O
( O
BSE O
) O
-- O
mad O
cow O
disease O
. O

But O
Fischler O
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU O
's O
standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O
officials O
, O
questioned O
if O
such O
action O
was O
justified O
as O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slight O
risk O
to O
human O
health O
. O

Spanish O
Farm O
Minister O
Loyola O
de O
Palacio O
had O
earlier O
accused O
Fischler O
at O
an O
EU O
farm O
ministers O
' O
meeting O
of O
causing O
unjustified O
alarm O
through O
" O
dangerous O
generalisation O
. O
" O

. O

Only O
France O
and O
Britain O
backed O
Fischler O
's O
proposal O
. O

The O
EU O
's O
scientific O
veterinary O
and O
multidisciplinary O
committees O
are O
due O
to O
re-examine O
the O
issue O
early O
next O
month O
and O
make O
recommendations O
to O
the O
senior O
veterinary O
officials O
. O

Sheep O
have O
long O
been O
known O
to O
contract O
scrapie O
, O
a O
brain-wasting O
disease O
similar O
to O

which O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O
cattle O
through O
feed O
containing O
animal O
waste O
. O

British O
farmers O
denied O
on O
Thursday O
there O
was O
any O
danger O
to O
human O
health O
from O
their O
sheep O
, O
but O
expressed O
concern O
that O
German O
government O
advice O
to O
consumers O
to O
avoid O
British O
lamb O
might O
influence O
consumers O
across O
Europe O
. O

a O

. O

The O
European O
Commission O
agreed O
this O
month O
to O
rethink O
a O
proposal O
to O
ban O
the O
use O
of O
suspect O
sheep O

after O
some O
EU O
veterinary O
experts O
questioned O
whether O
it O

banning O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O
and O
spinal O

from O

But O
some O
members O

questioned O
whether O
the O
action O
was O
necessary O
given O
the O
slight O

human O
health O

The O
question O
is O
being O

British O
officials O
say O
sheep O
meat O
is O
perfectly O
safe O

ZDF O

Lauck O

lawyer O
vowed O

would O
appeal O

arguing O
that O

had O
not O
committed O
any O

The O

hailed O
the O

a O
major O
victory O
in O
the O

against O

of O

material O
flowing O
into O

since O
the O
1970s O
. O

" O
Lauck O
possessed O
a O
well-oiled O

machine O
, O
honed O
during O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
, O
" O
presiding O

told O

" O
He O
set O
up O

" O

said O

read O
out O
extracts O
from O

praising O

said O

with O
the O
court O

sentence O

Publishing O

distributing O
neo-Nazi O
material O
is O
illegal O

but O
Lauck O

had O
argued O
that O

sporting O

But O
as O
Lauck O
was O
about O
to O

led O
away O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
reporters O
and O
blurted O
out O
a O
virtually O
incomprehensible O
quick-fire O
diatribe O
against O
the O

" O
Neither O

His O

told O

that O

how O

judge O

Bertram O

of O

During O

rejected O

that O

he O
was O

He O
will O
probably O
be O
free O
in O

The O

ruled O
that O

under O
many O
Russian O
barter O

, O
with O
nothing O

the O

of O
such O

was O

1.10 O

in O

were O
worth O

about O
eight O

, O
she O
said O
. O

" O
The O
cost O
of O
exported O
goods O
is O
too O
often O
understated O
, O
so O
the O
actual O
share O
of O
barter O

in O
Russian O
exports O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
unimported O

may O
be O
even O
higher O
, O
" O
Volkova O
said O
. O

A O
few O
days O
ago O
Russian O
President O
Boris O
Yeltsin O
issued O
a O
decree O
on O
state O
regulation O
of O
foreign O

, O
and O
Volkova O
said O
this O
" O
could O
substantially O
improve O

" O
. O

In O
line O
with O
the O
decree O
, O
which O
will O
come O
into O
force O
on O
November O
1 O
, O
all O
Russian O

will O
be O
obliged O
to O
import O
goods O

the O

of O
their O

within O
180 O
days O
. O

" O
If O

are O
late O
, O
they O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
fines O
worth O
the O

of O

goods O
, O
" O
Volkova O
said O
. O

Understating O
the O
cost O
of O
exported O
goods O
could O
still O
be O
a O
loophole O
for O

dealers O
, O
but O
Volkova O
said O
the O
authorities O
are O
currently O
" O

the O
technicalities O

Barter O
has O
always O

foreign O
trade O
, O
but O
Yeltsin O
's O
decrees O
liberalising O
foreign O
trade O
in O
1991-1992 O
has O
given O
barter O
a O
new O
impetus O
. O

A O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
barter O
deals O
accounted O
for O
up O
to O
25-30 O
percent O
of O
Russian O
exports O
because O
" O
thousands O

" O
, O
Volkova O
said O

" O
Now O
many O

" O
I O

Many O

apparently O
saw O
their O
crucial O
holiday O

suffer O
last O

because O
store O
shelves O
were O
jammed O
with O
blue-and-white O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
sales O
of O

the O

up O
46 O

last O

to O
a O
record O

8.67 O

Microsoft O

by O

the O

now O
used O
on O

But O
Enderle O
said O
the O
figure O
could O
have O
been O
even O
higher O
if O
Microsoft O

done O
a O
better O
job O
of O
handling O
the O
huge O

from O

He O
and O
other O
analysts O
said O
corporate O

adopted O
a O
go-slow O

now O
that O

Mystery O
has O
surrounded O
the O
Shanghai O
stockpile O
in O
recent O
months O
, O
with O
traders O
unsure O
not O
only O
of O
who O
owns O
it O
, O
but O
of O
its O
exact O
size O
and O
what O
its O
owner O
planned O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O

Trading O
sources O
generally O
agreed O
it O
would O
be O
cost-effective O
to O
take O
the O
copper O
back O
into O
a O
depleted O
central O
reserve O
as O
it O
had O
already O
served O
its O
purpose O
in O
taking O
advantage O
of O
long-term O
backwardation O
on O
the O
London O
Metal O
Exchange O
( O
LME O
) O
. O

A O
backwardation O
occurs O
when O
the O
spot O
price O
of O
a O
metal O
is O
higher O
than O
the O
forward O
price O
. O

CNIEC O
lent O
around O
85,000 O
tonnes O
of O
copper O
onto O
the O
LME O
between O
April O
and O
June O
1995 O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
state O
reserve O
, O
running O
the O
state O
stockpile O
down O
to O
115,000 O
tonnes O
from O
200,000 O
tonnes O
previously O
. O

Traders O
in O
Asia O
said O
CNIEC O
could O
well O
have O
lent O
it O
to O
the O
market O
at O
around O
US$ O
2,700 O
a O
tonne O
, O
and O
then O
paid O
somewhere O
between O
$ O
2,200 O
and O
$ O
2,400 O
a O
tonne O
when O
it O
started O
taking O
the O
metal O
back O
earlier O
this O
year O
. O

This O
would O
have O
cleared O
CNIEC O
a O
healthy O
profit O
, O
which O
could O
then O
have O
been O
used O
to O
finance O
storage O
and O
other O
costs O
. O

that O
CNIEC O
had O
offered O
the O
copper O
to O
