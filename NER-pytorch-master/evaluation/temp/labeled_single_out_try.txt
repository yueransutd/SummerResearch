Barroso S-PER
noted O
the O

how O
he O

whether O

went O
beyond O

It O
also O

up O

but O
what O

your O
take O
? O

Were O
Gus S-PER

Max S-PER
friends O
so O
close O
that O
they O
were O
like O
brothers O

I O
think O
the O
magic O
of O
really O
good O
television O
is O
to O
allow O
the O
audience O
to O
draw O
their O
own O
conclusion O

Certainly O
, O
there O
is O
a O
deep O

I O
would O

that O

I O
would O
go O
for O
the O
professional O
aspect O

be O
honest O
with O

that O

more O

Could O

James B-PER

( O
the O
actor O

) O
is O
a O
beautiful O
man O
. O

He O
plays O
the O
role O
so O
beautifully O
and O
seamlessly O
that O
it O
allowed O
all O
of O
those O
thoughts O

happen O

I O
think O
that O

what O
makes O
it O
great O
. O

To O
label O
it O
, O
to O
name O
it O
, O
to O
know O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
much O
less O
interesting O
. O

It O
's O
certainly O
and O
surely O
possible O
. O

Would O
it O
have O
been O
possible O
if O
they O
got O
a O
really O
ugly O
actor O
to O

guy O
? O

How O
defined O
was O
the O
character O
of O
Gus S-PER
when O
you O
signed O
on O
for O
the O
show O
? O

Was O
it O
written O
on O
the O
page O
that O
you O
would O
play O
him O
as O
this O
deliberate O
man O
, O
or O
did O
you O
make O
all O
these O
choices O
about O
how O
to O
portray O
him O
? O

I O
hate O
to O
take O
all O
of O
the O
credit O
for O
what O
I O
do O
, O
because O
the O
writing O
is O
so O
stellar O
and O
I O
pay O
such O
close O
attention O
to O
everything O
that O
's O
written O
, O
including O
the O
stage O
directions O
. O

I O
come O
from O

and O
they O

' O
Do O
n't O
read O

directions O
. O
' O

In O
' O

' O
I O
read O
every O

everything O
really O
is O
information O

appeared O

manager O

I O
always O
read O
into O
it O

he O
was O
keeping O

very O
big O

he O
was O

5 O
Questions O
Answered O
in O
the O
Season B-MISC
Premiere E-MISC

How O
did O
the O
character O
become O
integral O
to O
the O
story O
? O

What O
happened O
was O
that O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
that O
guest O
spot O
. O

Within O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
of O
me O
finishing O
the O
first O
one O
, O
they O
said O
, O
' O
Would O
you O
come O
back O
and O
do O
the O
season O
ender O
? O
' O

Then O
they O
came O
back O
and O
said O
, O
' O
Would O
you O
do O
more O
? O
' O

I O
said O
yeah O
, O
I O
would O
, O
but O
not O
as O
a O
guest O
star O
. O

They O
asked O
me O
to O
do O
seven O
more O
guest O
spots O
, O
and O
I O
said O
, O
' O
No O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
interested O
in O
that O
. O

I O
'm O
interested O
in O
really O
finding O
out O
who O
this O
character O
is O
. O
' O

I O
prefaced O
all O
of O
that O
by O
saying O
that O
I O
loved O
the O
show O
. O

I O
adore O
and O
think O
that O
Vince B-PER
Gilligan E-PER
is O
brilliant O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
just O
come O
in O
and O
out O
… O

I O
want O
to O
come O
in O
and O
have O
a O
full O
canvas O
to O
work O
with O
, O
and O
I O
expressed O
that O
. O

I O
wound O
up O
doing O
11 O
, O
which O
was O
a O
clear O
indication O
… O
of O
their O
trust O
and O
devotion O
to O
doing O
what O
I O
previously O
had O
asked O
for O
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
able O
to O
create O
a O
complete O
character O
and O
to O
be O
part O
of O
a O
family O
. O

But O
again O
, O
Gus S-PER
was O
just O
a O
nice O
guy O
who O
worked O
in O
the O
chicken O
joint O
, O
who O
probably O
had O
some O
secrets O
, O
and O
they O
were O
hoping O
to O
uncover O
some O
of O
that O
. O

I O
am O
in O
gratitude O
that O
they O
found O
, O
through O
my O
performance O
, O
that O
they O
would O
like O
to O
uncover O
a O
whole O
lot O
more O
. O

Which O
they O
definitely O
did O
, O
especially O
, O
as O
we O
discussed O
, O
in O
the O
" O
Hermanos S-PER
" O
episode O
. O

It O
was O
so O
satisfying O
for O
viewers O
to O
get O
a O
glimpse O
at O
what O
motivates O
Gus S-PER
… O

did O
you O
feel O
that O
way O
, O
too O
, O
when O
you O
read O
the O
script O
? O

I O
've O
done O
other O
shows O
and O
other O
series O
, O
and O
they O
go O
along O
, O
and O
you O
have O
a O
dual O
thing O
going O
on O
, O
where O
you O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
be O
on O
something O
that O
's O
quality O
, O
and O
to O
make O
some O
money O
and O
feed O
your O
family O
. O

Then O
, O
once O
( O
your O
character O
) O
gets O
your O
office O
or O
your O
home O
, O
you O
know O
you O
're O
going O
to O
be O
around O
for O
a O
while O
. O

You O
're O
like O
, O
' O
Yay O
, O
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
write O
me O
out O
. O

With O
this O
( O
episode O
) O
, O
the O
triumph O
was O
that O
they O
asked O
me O
for O
some O
family O
pictures O
. O

I O
brought O
in O
pictures O
of O
my O
four O
daughters O
and O
put O
them O
all O
on O
the O
wall O
. O

( O
Viewers S-LOC
) O
never O
really O
saw O
them O
, O
but O
just O
in O
case O
one O
day O
they O
did O
and O
wanted O
to O
reflect O
back O
to O
that O
scene O
, O
they O
could O
see O
my O
family O
, O
which O
meant O
( O
Gus S-PER
) O
could O
have O
a O
wife O
. O

other O
… O
I O
could O
be O
living O
like O
Gus S-PER
does O
in O
plain O
sight O
, O
but O
have O
the O
trimmings O
of O
the O
whole O
family O
. O

But O
, O
yes O
, O
for O
people O
to O
see O
the O
background O
of O
a O
character O
that O
you O
create O
and O
understand O
… O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
our O
villains O
that O
we O
experience O
, O
in O
many O
ways O
they O
're O
one O
note O
. O

I O
certainly O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
Gus S-PER
be O
that O

What O
truly O
motivates O
Gus S-PER
, O
especially O
going O
forward O
, O
now O
that O
he O
's O
got O
his O
revenge O
on O
Don B-PER
Eladio E-PER
and O
Tio S-PER
? O

I O
think O
that O
what O
motivates O
Gus S-PER
for O
much O
of O
what O
we O
've O
seen O
has O
been O
revenge O
, O
building O
his O
empire O
, O
playing O
his O
cards O
right O
. O

But O
since O
that O
really O
horrible O
moment O
that O
we O
finally O
see O
in O
( O
" O
Hermanos S-ORG
" O
) O
, O
we O
understand O
him O
a O
different O
way O
. O

It O
's O
not O
only O
revenge O
, O
but O
the O
revenge O
has O
played O
into O
taking O
over O
, O
into O
making O
this O
family O
his O
family O
. O

I O
think O
if O
we O
were O
to O
go O
back O
even O
further O
than O
that O
, O
we O
'd O
see O
his O
connection O
to O
the O
Pinochet O
government O
and O
where O
all O
the O
previous O
incarnations O
of O
Gus O
came O
from O
and O
what O
his O
dream O
for O
his O
empire O
is O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
seen O
that O
yet O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
motivation O
is O
a O
two O
- O
fold O
motivation O
. O

It O
's O
to O
bring O
people O
to O
their O
best O
selves O
in O
whatever O
they O
do O
, O
which O
is O
why O
he O

for O

has O
missed O
the O
boat O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
understanding O
that O
little O
good O
piece O
of O
what O
Gus S-PER
is O
trying O
to O
display O
. O

As O
viewers O
, O
as O
crazy O
as O
it O
sounds O
, O
we O
're O
actually O
kind O
of O
rooting O
for O
Gus S-PER

Despite O
everything O
he O
's O
done O
, O
the O
box O
cutter O
murder O
of O
his O
assistant O
, O
the O
threats O
to O
Walt S-ORG
's O
whole O
family O
, O
and O
what O
we O
know O
he O
's O
capable O
of O
… O

If O
that O
's O
the O
case O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
told O
that O
by O
others O
, O
then O
that O
means O
I O
've O
done O
my O
job O
really O
well O
. O

Because O
if O
in O
one O
week O
, O
you O
're O
really O
hoping O
that O
Jesse S-PER
takes O
that O
ricin O
cigarette O
and O
puts O
it O
in O
this O
food O
and O
kills O
Gus S-PER
, O
then O
in O
the O
very O
next O
episode O
Gus S-PER
stands O
down O
the O
cartel O
and O
you O
're O
like O
, O
" O
Yeah S-ORG
! O
" O
because O
those O
guys O
are O
worse O
than O
he O
is O
( O
laughing O
) O

I O
'm O
a O
thoughtful O
person O
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
be O
challenged O
. O

If O
you O
can O
go O
then O
, O
from O
one O
episode O
feeling O
like O
, O
' O
Oh S-PER
, O
gosh O
, O
I O
want O
him O
to O
be O
dead O
, O
' O
and O
then O
in O
the O
next O
episode O
going O
, O
' O
Wow O
, O
that O
was O
a O
great O
move O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
glad O
he O
did O
that O
, O
' O
it O
plays O
into O
my O
theory O
that O
nothing O
's O
really O
black O
and O
white O
. O

There O

some O
gray O
areas O

for O
all O

truly O
is O
a O
show O
where O

a O
wonderful O
way O

I O
know O
that O

It O
's O
interesting O

because O
I O
've O
read O
what O

talked O
about O

and O
I O
know O
from O
before O
we O
even O
finished O

four O
, O
people O
were O
asking O
. O

Vince S-PER
has O
already O
stated O
, O
he O
told O
me O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
that O
he O
only O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
five‑year O
series O
, O
because O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
to O
wind O
up O
. O

He O
's O
got O
to O
wind O
up O
Hank O
, O
finding O
out O
or O
not O
finding O
out O
. O

He O
's O
got O
to O
wind O
up O
all O
these O
different O
little O
aspects O
of O
this O
piece O
. O

I O
think O
a O
good O
storyteller O
acknowledges O
that O
there O
's O
a O
beginning O
, O
middle O
and O
end O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
discovery O
for O
him O
, O
as O
it O
will O
be O
for O
us O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
know O
right O
now O
. O

I O
just O
want O
to O
bask O
in O
the O
energy O
of O
this O
really O
pretty O
incredible O
fourth O
season O
and O
see O
what O

They O
leave O

an O
impolite O

because O

I O

guarantee O
you O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
good O
, O
quite O
, O
quite O
powerful O
, O
and O
will O
really O
give O
you O
pause O
to O

about O
how O

This O

There O

of O
German S-MISC
Chancellor O

Merkel O
warned O
last O

the O
threat O
of O

from O
a O
euro O

rescheduling O
its O

be O
huge O

only O

sense O
once O
it O

a O

Barroso S-PER
noted O
the O
euro O

had O
no O
experience O

the O
European B-ORG

convinced O
that O
a O

Germany S-LOC

have O
so O

been O
split O
over O
how O
to O
recapitalise O
Europe S-LOC

, O
which O
Ireland S-LOC
estimated O
on O

may O

to O

insisting O

be O
used O
as O
a O

Qatar S-LOC
is O
being O
cited O
by O

believe O

that O

Another O
key O
dispute O
is O
how O
to O
use O
the O
EFSF S-ORG
to O
buy O
sovereign O

to O
prevent O
contagion O
of O
the O
crisis O
, O
particularly O
crucial O
if O
Greece S-LOC

to O
secure O
its O
next O

France S-LOC
does O
not O
want O
to O
set O
guidelines O
for O
the O
EFSF S-ORG

whereas O
Germany S-LOC
wants O
to O
limit O

time O
limit O
for O

“ O
Given O
that O
the O
EFSF S-ORG

it O
makes O

, O
” O
Michael B-PER

, O
told O

There O
was O
a O
danger O
, O
otherwise O
, O
the O

he O
said O

Berlin S-LOC
could O
be O
prepared O
to O
allow O
a O
more O
flexible O
use O
of O
the O
EFSF S-ORG
to O
prop O
up O
states O

if O
Paris S-LOC

to O
a O
broad O
haircut O
on O

But O
a O

“ O
